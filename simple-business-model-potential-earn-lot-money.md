A simple "Business Model" with potential to earn a lot of money if you TAKE ACTION...
This is not a "spoon-feeding" type post...This is an overall idea and guide that works 100% if you implement it...You are left to figure out all the details for yourself as they will change depending on your unique situation.
PHASE 1:
1. Find a product to promote - clickbank will do
2. Spend at least 2 days reading forums on the Niche your product is in. This is purely to give you a good idea of what the market wants, it puts you in-sync with your market.
3. Create a squeeze page to collect visitors' email addresses. Use a professional auto responder like Aweber or GetResponse. Use articles for the follow up emails and call it a "mini series/course" and as the "BAIT" for the squeeze page.
4. Make sure your auto responder articles include links to your affiliate link of the clickbank product your are promoting
5. Make your "Thank you page" your affiliate link...so once a customer signs up to your list they are automatically redirected to your affiliate link
6. Find AT LEAST 10 other list owners promoting similar products or even the same product you are promoting.
7. Contact these 10 list owners, and get each of them to send out an email to their list promoting YOUR squeeze page...You can pay them to do this, or offer them a link building service or article writing service etc...
Your list grows AND you see some clickbank commissions...
PHASE 2:
Only GOAL of this phase is to expand your email list...
Use the money you earned form phase 1 and drive as much traffic as possible to your SQUEEZE PAGE - this builds your list.
At this stage you would have been promoting the product for a while...and you should have a great understanding of the product you are selling (And its market)
This is the point where you create your own product. Make sure your product is bigger and better than the existing product you are promoting. Promote your new product to your list...AND you will gain clickbank affiliates promoting your product.
Phase one is pretty detailed and somewhat useful. Page two and three are too vague. Sure, you can make your own product, but how does one go about doing that? There are thousands of people making products every day that fall flat on their face.
You need to be able to offer something genuinely unique. This constant product creating and rehashing model isn't going to continue to work. There is a reason that Google is going after the IM niche and Clickbank is creating more stringent guidelines.
You might have some success with this model, but I fear that it may be somewhat short term. It's much better to invest your time, energy, and money into a legitimate business.

you shouldn't be worrying about step 3 until your list has reached a reasonable size... which usually takes months. Once that happens I am sure you will have the knowledge on how to create a product.

This is a business model like the OP said. Not a detailed plan... that's up to you to get in the trenches and figure out. It's not Rocket Surgery!
The reason most people fall flat on their faces because they aren't making the right decisions. So how does one go about making the right decisions then... By failing and learning from those mistakes... Then picking up the pieces and fixing the problem.
You need to be able to offer something genuinely unique. This constant product creating and rehashing model isn't going to continue to work. There is a reason that Google is going after the IM niche and Clickbank is creating more stringent guidelines.
Creating a product yourself is unique in the way you convey and display your ideas. Everyone is different so the same material presented a different way will connect better with some people over others. Take a look at how many times movie plots have been rehashed and yet everyone still goes and watches, right?
You might have some success with this model, but I fear that it may be somewhat short term. It's much better to invest your time, energy, and money into a legitimate business.
What the OP has described is a legitimate business model. So I'm curious as to what you consider a "legitimate" business? (Besides creating a J.O.B. for yourself)
I think threads like this do people a dis-service. It's extremely unlikely the OP has actually done this or anything close to it.
For those of us with some experience, we see several issues with this plan being a way most people can have much if any success.
But it get posted and people end up following this very un-proven method. It is sad really.
I'm sorry you think i am doing everyone a "dis-service" - I was really just trying to help.
As for it being an un-proven method...you are simply wrong. Have you proven it wrong? Have you tried this strategy? Probably not...
But it HAVE...and i HAVE made money from it...

It is deceptive marketing. He is not earning $50k a month from this method. He is actually not earning anything from this method. Until it is proven, it is a misleading claim.
Point noted...I have changed the heading...

I think you have been reading the wrong sig...
Nowhere does it say I build and sell mini sites. I have never offered this kind of service, and neither do I intend to

I am not the one thats been flaming business models. There are many "legitimate" business models in my eyes...including Google and Facebook advertising.
This is definitely a cliffs notes version on how to do it, but the method you outlined is correct. Product creation seems to be where the big bucks are, and when done correctly (quality products, truthful marketing) the earning potential is limitless. Someday down the line I think I'll give this a try (once I can actually make a website and market products).
someone who has made 50K a month would say when you implement this, not "if". i know i am not as smart as you on the Internet, as of yet, i have made nothing online, but after making OVER 8 figures net offline and 7 figures from zero in 2 years-3 times!, i know how to make money. so....have you made the money you state here using this very vague formula? i will follow it exactly if you have, there are many who would love to make 5K a month right now and need the help. c'mon savior, please show us your stuff! 1% of the US makes over $200K a year. in my last business, that was ONE month. (close, i made $6,000 a day, 7 days a week, working 45 minutes a week, after two years of non-stop work with no pay in MY business) so, i can show you how to make 2 million a year for years, because i did it. the business plan i wrote was much more detailed than yours too, so i am all ears! tx, Dr. Mike

Yeah sorry about that guys, I started this thread thinking I'm going to make a killer post, but got REALLY tired as I was writing and was half falling asleep over my laptop (WAAY too many hours working..) So I basically rushed through it and did a half-assed job - my fault and im sorry...
To address your question, after promoting the vendor's product for a few months, you will have a pretty good idea of what the market wants. So this will already steer you in the right direction of where to start..then you would hire researchers to do additional MARKET research and then obviously product specific research. Then a writer would create the actual product. And then you could hire a designer to create a PDF template if its an eBook and create your product this way..
Remember...I mentioned creating a product bigger and better than the product you are promoting...so purchasing the actual product you are promoting and then bettering where it lacks would be a good place to start..
Also just a note on this not being a "legitimate business model" as you put it:
What's not legitimate about creating a product that a market wants and then selling it to them? In my opinion, there are MANY MANY other less legitimate models on the internet...

Yes, well we all know that owning your own products is where the big money lays...the biggest reason for this is because you get to leverage the power of many other people selling for you (your affiliates).
It is very difficult to gain this type of leverage when promoting someone elses product - this is where you would have to be creative in your marketing and often THIS is where the so called "illegitimate" business models come from
Do it right, as you said TRUTHFUL marketing, with a QUALITY product that TRULY gives the market what they need and you will make an absolute killing

NO...I am NOT currently earning $50k / month using this method.
I do however make a full time living online and I am earning more than the 10% of this beks001 mentions...
I have been involved behind the scenes with various other product launches which has earned me a lot more than $50k...but I was never the sole owner of these products and my earnings did not last at that level for a long time.
I am currently involved in various other "business models" at the moment where I am building a business that gives more consistent long term income
There are many of these types of posts on the forum, and do you think each of those posters are earning what their title says?
The $50k in my title was meant more of a hypothetical term to make the readers realize they can earn a lot of money with this type of "business model". Im sorry if my title was misleading, it was not my intention to mislead anyone.
Sometimes the problem with methods, ideas and brainstorming within the marketing communities online is that everyone thinks this industry is an exact science - and that if they perform steps A, B, and C exactly as stated they will earn the EXACT amount stated to the cent!
Sorry to inform you my friends, but this is not the case. IM is not an exact science and there are ALWAYS compromises, changes and creativity put into ALL CAMPAINGS and "business models"
So rather than be worried if you are going to earn $50k a month following my vague outline...take that vague outline and make it your own - maybe you only make $20k??

Generally if someone has a list, they do not mind blasting my offer to their subscribers if I pay them.
In the beginning when I used to do this, and didnt have cash to pay them for a blast or feature in their newsletter, I would offer them a Link building campaign or something similar in exchange for a blast to their list...some would accept, but most would decline.
In the end its a numbers game, and it helps if you have cash to offer them. You may speak to 10 or 15 List owners before 1 gives you a deal
After you have a product, affiliates have no problem promoting your product for commission

Seems like you have things pretty sorted with your offline ventures..congrats..so why do you want to come F**k around online then??
This is the problem with so many people coming to look online for riches...they look for an EXACT SCIENCE...as have you mister business guru..
The most important piece of advice I give anyone wanting to make money online, is treat it as a REAL business! Because thats exactly what it is...it's going to need investment, and time and work and hiring of professionals just like any offline business...

I truly hope that there has been at least SOME positive out of my post. In the future, I will be sure to post a much more detailed layout of the marketing technique used, and EXACT figures of how much was earned from it...maybe then someone will actually read it and try to take some of the information in...

No offense was intended by my comment and I do wish you well with this endeavor, but the very reason that I stated (misleading headline) is the very reason this thread has gotten all that attention.
Just the like WSOs with Big Money Claims.
The thing is ... people who aren't good at selling, and there are lots of them, could really get bitten in the posterior doing this and end up with a boatload of free mobile sites to do for people and little more.
Any reasonable person would/should have the expectation that this is being said by someone who has actually done it themselves. Unfortunately, in the absence of revisiting this thread, there's no way to know--so we are just left to jump to conclusions.
What he has said is the very basic of marketing and it will work 100% if you are willing to put time and effort into it and it is not a method per se, it is common sense.
I once read in a Jimmy D Brown book, making money online or offline is a simple matter and consists of these steps:
1. Find an offer
2. Drive targeted traffic to the offer
When this model is adopted online, it allows you to fail fast which means success comes real early because you are able to test out products/target audience really quickly. To those who do not believe in this..listen to this interview or read the transcript below
Now for the flamers who are going to comment here: No, i do not currently make 50K online and i do not use this method but i make decent high 4 figures online and currently have a day job but i will be starting full time online in 2 months and will start building a list soon.
And to someone who mentioned having a 2 million per annum income and business plan.. Would you share something like that on a public forum.. i would love to read..
This is not a "spoon-feeding" type post...This is an overall idea and guide that works 100% if you implement it...You are left to figure out all the details for yourself as they will change depending on your unique situation.
Here's how to make at least $50K a month:
PHASE 1:
1. Find a product to promote - clickbank will do
2. Spend at least 2 days reading forums on the Niche your product is in. This is purely to give you a good idea of what the market wants, it puts you in-sync with your market.
3. Create a squeeze page to collect visitors' email addresses. Use a professional auto responder like Aweber or GetResponse. Use articles for the follow up emails and call it a "mini series/course" and as the "BAIT" for the squeeze page.
4. Make sure your auto responder articles include links to your affiliate link of the clickbank product your are promoting
5. Make your "Thank you page" your affiliate link...so once a customer signs up to your list they are automatically redirected to your affiliate link
6. Find AT LEAST 10 other affiliates promoting similar products or even the same product you are promoting.
7. Contact these 10 affiliates, and get each of them to send out an email to their list promoting YOUR squeeze page...You can pay them to do this, or offer them a link building service or article writing service etc...

This is the point where you create your own product. Make sure your product is bigger and better than the existing product you are promoting. Promote your new product to your list...AND you will gain clickbank affiliates promoting your product.
This would work, it would just take 5 years of list building.. :confused:
I'll want to give a bit of insight into what the OP has put up. And no, i do not make 50k monthly, but i have a similar business model that i am trying to implement at the moment and i have gone through some considerable aspect of what he highlighted and i want to share my experience in that regard.
a. Find a product to promote on clickbank - i noticed that the first thing to do is research. While doing a bit of research, i stumbled on a long tail keyword generating about 30,000 searches per month and it has very low competition. I then searched on clickbank to find out if there are products that could be sold to individuals searching those keywords and i found a few. I checked on amazon as well and found some products. However, i'll be going ahead with the clickbank ones as they pay a higher margin.
b. Spend at least two days on forums - i didn't visit forums. I visited a lot of blogs and started reading peoples comments. It helped me to know exactly the prroblems they are having and how to approach it. I also used it to learn more about the niche itself. For instance, if the niche is about "how to fly a plane", i visited various blogs where the process were highlighted and read and read to give me a bit of knowledge.
c. Create a squeeze page - Over the last 48 hours, i've been working on a squeeze page based on the niche i found. its been pretty difficult as i am not professional with web design. What i did was copied someone else's web page layout (deleted the entire content) and just fix in the content i had written. NOTE: i did not use any of their stuffs. I just used the layout. And i used microsoft frontpage to design it too.
By the way, i tried searching for squeeze pages on google but the ones i found where rubbish and wouldn't convert. I bet i couldnt make use of them because i am not able to optimize the design.
d. Use articles for the follow up and call it a mini series - Personally, i did not do that. prior to two days ago, i had spent another 3 days creating a 20 page report on that particular niche. I did put a lot of time into researching very good content as i know content that is bad is worthless. I included pictures and "how tos" in my ebook. I then gave it to two friends to look it over and they found it pretty informative.
e. Write autoresponder emails - at the time of reading this post, i am currently writing the autoresponder emails. I plan on writing 21 messages and spread it over 2 months or so. They include informative emails and promotional emails.
The above is all i have done so far. Once i am done with the autoresponder, it will be time for me to start promoting my squeeze page. I know google does not allow thin websites, so i am shelving google. I'll be using facebook and some other strategies that i cannot share on here. By the way, the OP's idea of "asking other affiliate to send out email to their list for your own squeeze page is an effective one and is already in use on this forum. Its called adswap or solo ads. If you go to the JV section, you'll see it on there.
While i do agree that the OP's topic was misleading, the framework/blueprint he gave above are achievable. I know this because the model i am working on now was a model i read in a book written by a super affiliate that made over $10,000 per month with this idea.
And i plan to use it to make at least $5000 per month myself.
I hope my explanation helps the newbies out there. And i forgot to say that my cost are:
....I'll want to give a bit of insight into what the OP has put up.

Awesome stuff. Thanks for taking the time to break it down a little...
I hope EVERYONE notices how you have been doing things slightly different..This is KEY! And part of the reason I tried to leave things vague (Might have over done it a little though)
One of the biggest lessons any newbie can learn, is that there is not a single method,strategy or model out there that can be taken and replicated EXACTLY and made to work with the same results. The basic outline can work, but in the end you need to take the method and make it your own. You need to change things up a bit and tweak it to suite YOUR particular situation...just as you have. Then test, test and test till its tweaked for optimum performance. Just like you will end up doing too...
Nick, I was set up to blast you for using a deceptive title to get traffic for a future offer. You changed the headline to something reasonable, so I dumped the blast unfired.
I'm pretty sure it was unintentional, but you were following a common pattern in the beginning.
> Make a huge promise with a big income claim.
> Take "useful but incomplete" to a high level to generate responses.
> After a while, lo and behold, there's the product "since so many people asked for it."
People heard the quack and went looking for the duck. Nothing personal.
As for the original post... the critical flaw in the plan reminds me of the South Park episode with the underwear gnomes.
The entire concept (as many others in this illustrious world of make money online biz op) hinges upon convincing others to mail to their list.
You can be certain that it would likely be a frigid day in Hades before I mailed a Clickbank product of ANY sort to my list, let alone a squeeze page for a Clickbank product affilate. It would take an extremely unique and exceptional product/situation before I sent things like that out to my list. That would be a surefire way to nuke my own credibility, and piss off people that have come to expect real value from me.
It's all nice on paper, but the overwhelming majority of list owners are wary of the offers people present to them, research the links and offers of prospective partners BEFORE mailing it out.
People simply aren't that stupid - which is a very huge missing element in so much of the IM stuff that gets kicked around.
Anyone who promotes "...and then get list owners to send the offer..." as part of their grand scheme automatically gets the microscope magnification drilled down on their theory.
I do not own a paypal account since paypal is not supported in my country.
2.
I always get stuck on writing articles and stuff since I am not that good on it nor I have money to invest to make them written for me.
Any other source for traffic?
It REALLY does not matter! Clickbank, Amazon, CPA, CJ etc etc... ALL can work. Clickbank was just an example but if you find a good product on another network with great potential...then go for it!
As for content, your best bet would be to simply pay someone to research and write content for you. Check the warriors for hire section or even freelance sites like odesk, freelancer or even fiverr...
But with content, you need to remember that cheaper is NOT always better...

once i start seeing result i'll put up a thread on it
CPA can work just as good...the only difference is that CPA offers tend to change fairly often...

Fair enough. But you were right, it was totally unintentional...
Oh and I appreciate you dumping the "Flaming" stuff!

Anyone who promotes "...and then get list owners to send the offer..." as part of their grand scheme automatically gets the microscope magnification drilled down on their theory.
I hear you...but remember when approaching list owners in a particular niche, I don't contact them saying:
"...I have a squeeze page promoting a Clickbank product, please send a recommendation to your subscribers..."
it would be something more along the lines of:
"...I have a great, FREE mini series of content about X which your readers might find useful...would you mind checking it out, and maybe we can make a deal for you to recommend them the link..."
I think this all comes down to two simple factors...
1. How you "sell" the idea to the list owner... and
2. The quality of your content
Notice I said to use articles as the auto responder series. These articles need to be truly useful to readers in a particular niche...this is also the reason I said to first spend at least two days doing market research...this way your articles in the email series WILL in fact contain information that the niche will find interesting or useful.
If someone came to you asking for a deal to recommend good content to your readers...and after you check it out and realize it is actually useful content...you might be more inclined to consider a deal, EVEN if it means your subscribers need to give their email address to get it, and that the content is used to promote a product at the same time...
But even after all this you may, as a list owner, personally STILL not want to recommend the content to your list - which is fair enough. Me as a marketer using this particular plan would simply move onto the next list owner. As I mentioned before, its a numbers game and I might need to talk to 10 or 15 list owners before I get one that makes a deal.
Another thing to remember is that not all list owners care as much for their list as you may do. And they may see the deal as a simple and quick way to score something out of the deal. Another type of list owner is that of the LAZY kind...these guys might even care about their lists, but not have the time (or energy) to send them new content...these guys are all too happy to have new content to recommend to their lists...while making a quick buck out of the deal at the same time...
I am fascinated by how many people want to focus on the negative and glaze right over the fact that:
A. He was trying to help
B. His "business model" is sound - even though it's light in detail, that's exactly what he said he was offering.
I've made money doing almost exactly those same steps, save for the getting other list owners to mail for me. But, I also never attempted to get other list owners to mail for me. In fact, I still make irregular sales from random products in clickbank and I haven't even promoted my squeeze pages for ages.
Is it gonna put 50K in your pocket every month? Probably not unless you're willing to take some serious initiative and grow a MASSIVE list.. but will it make you money? Hell yes it will.
Take some INITIATIVE and figure it out, adapt, and make **** happen. If anyone here thinks they're going to find a "1, 2, 3" exact step technique for starting a business that doesn't require you using your head and making your own UNIQUE decisions... you're sorrily mistaken.

In fact, I still make irregular sales from random products in clickbank and I haven't even promoted my squeeze pages for ages.
Is it gonna put 50K in your pocket every month? Probably not unless you're willing to take some serious initiative and grow a MASSIVE list.. but will it make you money? Hell yes it will.
Take some INITIATIVE and figure it out, adapt, and make **** happen. If anyone here thinks they're going to find a "1, 2, 3" exact step technique for starting a business that doesn't require you using your head and making your own UNIQUE decisions... you're sorrily mistaken.
Thanks, pretty much exactly what I've been trying to say...and PROOF from someone other than me that "model" in concept works...just make it your own...

There's no new information; just a slightly different angle perhaps.
mr2monster, it's not his business model - it's a generic, well-known (and applied) one
Ian, the point of my post was only to try and help others. It may be a well known model for you and I, but there are definitely many people that have not gone this route in promoting their business...
It was meant only as a generic framework from which to work...and maybe give a few people some new trains of thought...
