The EXACT strategy i use to rank for ANY KEYWORD!


I’ve seen a lot of talk about SEO and link building strategies lately, and thought I’d chip in and give you guys the EXACT SEO strategy I personally use to rank my own websites.
Using my strategy, you work on only ONE keyword at a time. I work in SEO “cycles” each cycle targets and builds links for that ONE keyword. When the cycle is completed, I target the next keyword in another cycle dedicated to that keyword. The point here is not to target more than one keyword at a time in the same SEO Cycle.
Each cycle takes a considerable amount of time, and although it’s possible to do it entirely on your own I HIGHLY recommend you outsource the work. If you attempt to do everything yourself, you will burn yourself out within a few weeks, and will probably want to give up on IM completely!
So as soon as you can afford it, get others to complete this work for you.
(SEE FURTHER ON IN THE THREAD FOR A LIVE CASE STUDY)
This is how I get these results:
STEP 1: Pick a keyword
Pick ONE keyword on your site to target in the SEO cycle. If it’s a very difficult keyword, first add a new article to your site. If it’s easy to moderate competition, then this is not necessary.
STEP 2: Creating PROMO Content
Here you need to create all the content you will be using in the SEO cycle.
1. Start with an article related to your niche. This article does NOT have to target the keyword you are trying to rank for; it just needs to be about something relating to your niche. Then add spin syntax to the article (The Best spinner or Magic Article Re-writer works good). If you do not have money to buy one of these, I think there is a free version of spinner chief that will do the job.
NOTE: DO NOT automatically spin this article!! You need to manually spin each word so that the article is at least 60% unique. The idea is that when you generate a unique article, that it is the type of quality you would be willing to put on your website or submit to ezine articles (It must be THAT Good!) An article that does not read easy or make proper sense will NOT DO! (Trust me, I have extensively tested this)
Also remember to spin the title well – multiple titles all spun together works best.
Add two links in the article. Normally my one link goes to the page with the target keyword (The keyword is used as anchor text). My other link is normally linked to my home page (where my site’s main keyword is used as anchor text). Make sure that each time you spin the article the links are left intact.
2. Generate 2 unique versions of your promo article. Use these 2 articles and create 1 PDF file and 1 Power Point Slide show. Remember to add plenty of pictures.
3. Use Animoto, and create a video based on the article. The video must be at least 1min to 2min long. The easiest way to do this is to read the article, and pick a few facts you want to bring across in the video. Then spread the facts over a few text modules and simply add relevant pictures in between.
Remember to watermark your site URL at the bottom of the video.
You will need at least an Animoto Plus account to create full length videos – I think this only costs about $30 a year now.
STEP 3: Unleash the Promo content to the world!
As you submit your content to the various sites, it would be a good idea to copy each page’s URL that you create into a text document. You will be using these URL’s later.
1. Firstly, create a YouTube account and submit the Video to YouTube. Remember to start the video description with the full page URL of the target page you are trying to rank for. Ex. http://www.yoursite.com/target_page.html
2. Create accounts on Scribd and SlideShare. Submit the PDF file to Scribd. Then submit the Power Point Slide Show to Slide Share
Then MANUALLY submit UNIQUE versions of your promo article to each one. BUT, embed your YouTube video in each, and include AT LEAST one relevant picture.
Sometimes some of the web2.0’s will delete your pages – but it’s still well worth the effort trying to submit to them.
This is probably the most boring and time consuming part of the entire SEO cycle. In the beginning I created a bot using UBOT to sign up to all these sites for me. But now days I got people working for me in the Philippines that take care of this.
4. Blog Networks. There are 8 Blog networks that I submit my Promo article to. Some may require you to remove the links from the body, and put them in a resource box instead. My article is submitted to the following networks: Article Blueprint, Distribute Your Articles, Blog Blueprint, Authority Link Network, Article Ranks, Free Traffic system, My Article Network and SEO Extreme.
5. SenukeX Campaign: I then run an automated web2.0 campaign using SenukeX (“Social Network” Campaign in SenukeX). I use the same Promo article as content, with links in the article body. I DO NOT submit to the same sites I already submitted to manually (Those where the YouTube video was embedded). This normally gives me additional 25 or 26 properties with my article and links.
6. Article Marketing Robot campaign. I have over 15k article directories in my AMR, just got the lists for free on the internet and added them as I got them. Out of these I successfully submit to about 1,500 sites and get about 300 to 400 which auto approve my article.
Again, if you are targeting a difficult keyword then it is recommended to write a new article to blast with AMR. But for Medium to easy competition keywords this is not necessary.
Do not include links in your content body for AMR blasts. They need to be in a resource box. I normally include two keywords in my resource box – one to my site (target keyword as anchor text) and the other to a random URL of the manual web2.0 sites, including the Docstoc, SlideShare, Scribd and YouTube URL’s or an inner page of your site. This can all be randomized using spin syntax.
STEP 4: Strengthen your links!
This part is often overlooked by so many marketers, yet it is absolutely essential to getting results. Do not quit your SEO cycle half way through; else you will be greatly disappointed with your results.
1. Thorough Social Bookmarking campaign. Use SenukeX or Book Marking Demon and social bookmark the following URL’s to all the Social Bookmarking sites:
a. All Manually Created Web2.0 pages
b. YouTube Video URL
c. SlideShare, Docstoc and Scribd pages
2. Quick Social Bookmarking campaign. Again use SenukeX or Book Marking Demon and bookmark the AMR links. This does not have to be thorough. The idea is simply to bookmark each AMR URL on at least three social bookmarking sites.
NOTE: Each feed should only contain about 50 URLS. You should have about 4 or 5 RSS feeds after all the URL’s are added into feeds.
Then use SenukeX and submit these RSS feeds to all the RSS aggregators. And use the Pinger module in SenukeX to Ping all the RSS feeds as well.
4. ScrapeBox Blast. Use scrapebox and blast the following urls:
a. All Manually created web2.0 pages
b. All SenukeX created web2.0 pages
c. All AMR created pages
d. Money Site (Only if it is well aged)
I have simply searched the internet for free auto-approve lists. I normally blast to about 60K to 100k blogs.
And there you have it! That marks the end of one SEO cycle, and it means you should get started with the next!
Regarding Accounts, I only ever create new accounts when I start working on a new site. Some sites have 10+ SEO cycles done on them already, and the same set of accounts was used! I always use proxies, sometimes private, paid proxies and other times just free scraped proxies from scrapebox.
I have NEVER EVER had ANY kind of penalty using this strategy. All the sites I received good page one rankings for have stayed there for months and months with no additional work from me.
Feel free to adjust this strategy to your own needs.
Once you have done this a couple of times, one person should be able to complete 2 to 3 of these cycles a week. Each of my assistants in the Philippines can complete 2 cycles a week, and get started on the third!
It’s a TON of work for one person, but if you are willing to put in the work you will definitely see great results. I hope this strategy will be useful to at least some of you.
Remember, if you like the post don’t forget to hit THANKS!
Regards
Nick
!! GREAT NEWS !!
After countless PM's basically begging me for an outsourcing solution - I have finally caved!
You can now make use of the EXACT SAME freelancers I personally use to complete these cycles. They are already trained for the tasks, and I already have pre-existing agreements set up with them - which you can take opportunity of as well!
Did you just copy that from another internet marketing forum? As it's 1 on 1 exactly the same. You only changed the order a little.
Nik0,
The fact that he tried to help us to rank and offered a free advice doesn't mean he copied, I don't want you to take this personal but you are offering SEO services and in the forum you are asking questions about SEO and spun content.. how do you blame him that he copied and you don't even know what you are offering

Don't you sheep know how to use the internet. This is beyond copied; it's stolen. Still don't understand what's behind the motivation of "Nick" to do so...
Thanks to Nick's strategies for the SEO cycle, my site has finally made it back to the first page of Google for two competitive keywords after doing the Google Dance for over a month. My site was not ranked on the first page since December 2 and not it's back! The good part about the cycle is that I only did about %75 of the steps. Hopefully my site keeps going up.
Then MANUALLY submit UNIQUE versions of your promo article to each one. BUT, embed your YouTube video in each, and include AT LEAST one relevant picture.
when you said UNIQUE.. do you mean the :
2. Generate 3 unique versions of your promo article. Use these 3 articles and create 2 PDF files and 1 Power Point Slide show. Remember to add plenty of pictures.
I am kind of confused here.. do we need to create another unique articles for the web 2.0 or we used the 3 that we already have..
Thanks
Hey Zaco. No you don't use the same 3...what you do is spin ONE article PROPERLY (at least 50% unique) - then while its in spin syntax, you can easily use The Best Spinner or Magic Article ReWriter (Or similar) to generate unique versions of this article.
Then the first 3 uniques you generate are used for 2 PDF files and 1 Power Point slide Sow.
Then when you submit to the manual web2.0 sites, you first generate a unique article each time before you submit to a new web 2.0 - this way every property you submit your article to, has a unique version of it displayed.

Interesting concepts Nick. It sounds like there is a life cycle to the SEO value of these links. Am I right in saying the SEO value is in the diversity and Theme of the sites providing the links?
Also, I have seen where adding backlinks to articles will prolong the SEO value (indexing) of the article. Thoughts?
Love the case study and thanks for posting.
Hi, thanks. And yeah the value is definitely in the diversity of the links..and also in the fact that all the links are found in really useful, related content. Not just some spun rubbish linking to your site.
Backlinking articles definitely helps. But again, diversity is key. Do not use EXACTLY the same strategy to build links to ALL your web2.0 properties.
The fact that he tried to help us to rank and offered a free advice doesn't mean he copied, I don't want you to take this personal but you are offering SEO services and in the forum you are asking questions about SEO and spun content.. how do you blame him that he copied and you don't even know what you are offering

Hi Zaco. Thanks for coming up for me bud, but there are always going to be haters...so you might as well just ignore them.

I read your article again and again， thx very much.
I have a question for the target keyword.
You mean target a keyword one time, is it safe now?
Could you give me some advice for medium niche
site? i dont think i need so much work for a medium-small niche site.
I would not use ONLY the keyword as anchor text anymore. Mic in generic words like "click here" or "this site" etc etc.. as well. In fact, according to the micro site masters blog post (see my previous reply) - the most successful sites have only about 25% of their anchor texts as their target keyword - the rest is all generic words...

Agreed, thats why i hire a team of outsources to run through this for me...

Like mentioned elsewhere, it may be worth a try to give Magic Submitter a go. I had both for a while, but I always seemed to get better results with Senuke.
Another option would be to simply pay someone with Senuke to run this part of the campaign for you. Fiverr has got tons of Senuke campaigns for $5...

Yes, you are correct...takes time and effort, but in the end it all pays off. The secret about getting someone else to do this for you, is to build a relationship with them. You will never ever be able to get the random freelancer to do this for you whenever you feel like it.
Some of my guys took up to a month to get into things properly...only then, when they become productive does it become profitable.
Also, it helps to spread the tasks over multiple people. Have one person creating accounts, another writing content and then two or three posting the content.

Not necessarily...once you get into it, its not that much effort. And the easy to medium keywords rank almost instantly...within a few days...

Nick,
Come on dude !!
How can you say this strategy is yours when the exact same strategy appears on another forum titled "my SEO blueprint" ???
The thread on the other forum was first started in April 2011 which is eight months BEFORE you started it here.
Now unless you're the same guy on the other forum (which I suspect you're not otherwise you would have mentioned it when someone else accused you of using someone else's strategy) then I really think you need to 'fess up.
The thing is you seem to have a handle on the strategy and know what you're talking about but you've clearly seen the other thread I'm referring to as there are just too many similiarities between your post and Cash202's.
I don't want to stir any trouble but I've been following the other SEO blueprint and looking for more info on google when your strategy appeared in Google.

Thanks, dude. I am cash202 from the other forum. So funny. You really
know you're successful when other people start to rip you off almost
verbatim.
Hi Nick, thanks for this great post.
I don't have the time to do all this work. You mentioned outsourcing. Can you tell me how much it will cost to outsource one cycle and where I can find good people who can do this job.

Hi there, fantastic thread NickWatson, just what i was looking for, thank you.
Can I also enquire about the outsourcing resources?
Might I expect a MP too?
Interesting strategy. I will have to try this out with one of my sites. I'll come back to share my results. Thanks for the great share.
Thanks and that will be great! Would LOVE to read some other people results with this. I look forward to it...

Also about the videos, its not that I don't have tools, if I need to I can get them, but the reason I don't like to make videos is because of the content. The sites I have right now are the following. One is based on amazon product reviews, another has just one product for review and third one is adsense based site. Because I don't really have physical products on hand, that's the reason I don't like doing videos as I don't know what would I show in those videos.
Did you ever do videos for adsens based or amazon review sites? Any ideas as to how to make videos for those sites? Appreciate anything that you can give me. Thanks
Yeah plenty of my sites are adsense-based. And the videos are much simpler than you think. I simply take my promo article used for the cycle, and break it up into a few facts or tips. Then I get a bunch of relevant pictures and simply put it all together with animoto. The videos dont have to be absolute masterpieces...but keep them longer than 1min. The idea is more to get more diverse links to your site - by having a few videos (along with all the other types of sites) also linking to your site.

Just a little more steps, use a tool like market samurai (or ahrefs) to check out the top 10 sites anchor text. If you are trying to rank for "weight loss for teenagers" and you find that the top couple spots have a couple hundred links targeting this exact keyword, then move on (unless you want to work on a long term plan of course) Seriously, forget about the rest of the search engine results, just analyse the top 10.
Cheers
Jared
Thanks and thats a great tip...i'll be honest I have not really checked into the anchor words of THEIR links...but I might start doing just that...another way to reduce my risk of wasting time in the long run is always worth checking out!
I started my cycle today (very competitive KW and I currently am stuck at #5) and it is a lot of work, let me tell you but I know it will be worth it. It actually feels good to be doing all this manually again...been so long since I did anything manual. This is nice to be able to build all these web 2.0 sites the way I want them built and making them look good. Using software you cant really achieve this, I have senukex and it doesn't build them as good as I can manually build them.
I created a video and it is already ranked #8 for videos (in just 2 hours) for very competitive word. I also did the pdf, PowerPoint, and posted to 3 web 2 sites. Still have lots more to do.
I will post my results in a few weeks! Thank you very much for this amazing post, you could have easily sold this strategy for $10-$20 but I know you are already successful and don't need to. Thanks again for awesome info and strategy!!!
Note---If you do sell a product I will be there to buy it
Tip---Spinner Chief is the best manual spinner on the market.(free version is awesome) I have several others and they all have something they are the best at. In this case, my software I use for one-click spins that makes articles probably 85% readable was not used. I am doing exactly what Nick says to do.
Great stuff! And thanks!
I'm glad you are taking action, be sure to come back and post your results...will be very interesting considering your keyword is so very competitive.
I'll keep an eye out for your update!

I have create PDF of my article and post to Scribd and Docstoc, When I check ranking, the PDF in Scribd and Docstoc high ranking than my article, #2 and #5 on Top 10 and my article is #9 . Should I post on Scribd or not ?

Yes i always submit to Scribd and Docstoc...im not sure i understand your question though? Did you put the same article on your website? Because you should NOT put the same content on your website, the content you submit to these sites should be totally different.
But anyway, you will always have some of these properties ranking as well...but that is fine, because they get traffic, people click on the links and visit your site too...
This is one of the reasons I DO NOT target my target keyword in the promo content - i dont want the web2.0 properties competing with my site...so just make the promo articles about anything else in your niche...as long as its related to your niche you will be fine...

Yes,I did .I put the same content with my site. I get some traffic when they click links into PDF file. I create article about coupon product, and use wordpress plugin print PDF file and upload this PDF to Scribd and Docstoc.
This way help my article index very fast, but ranking less than them on Google.
So, how can I put content totally different ? Create other articles related with my target keyword and put to Web2.0 ?

Sent you a pm...
Hi Nick.
Can you send me the same PM? I'm also interested to know how much it costs to outsource a cycle and where to find good outsourcers for this.
Maximum kudos to Nick in SA for this posting. This is like a treasure trove and inspired me. I was already using Fiverr for other things, seems like with just a bit of good direction (as Nick is providing) you can make a huge difference.
Until now I'd been very skeptical of SEO experts... this finally provided the ammo I needed to engage and move forwards.
I think i will get a US based writer to create the original promo content and also add spin syntax. I can get them to spin both word and sentences to ensure i get better results.
That way i can ensure all spun versions of the article will be high quality.
So get the master syntax copy created and then just spin it twice in the bestspinner and use these versions for the pdf and powerpoint correct?
this will be an interesting case study, i have never used these kind of link building tactics
Sounds like you have a good plan there...and the top quality content is what really makes these cycle's work so well. Make sure the article is at least 50% unique (You should have no problem if spinning at sentence-level too)
Will be great if you come back and post your results...we would all love to read about it.

Thanks bud. And im glad you going to finally take action. As you get results coming in, come back and post them here for us all to read about.
I randomly came across this thread, packed full of very valuable information.
The guy that keeps complaining about some other program that is very close - we are all learning here, so thanks for starting the thread, so that more people can improve their skills.
I used to use Matt LeClair's 5000 links (5000 spun articles over 5000 blogs, with link signatures) and a guaranteed page 1 ranking. I bought a TON of his stuff, and am still ranking for those very competitive terms. His products are no longer working (maybe he got kicked off the blog subscription???) Have been looking a long time for something that will be as effective, purchased many WSOs for link building, etc, but nothing has been effective.
This thread has given me hope - although it's not as easy as clicking on a PayPal button and have someone do it. But all success requires work.
As for people who are looking for outsourcers, I have been using easyoutsource.com. I post a job, tons of people will submit their services. I will ask them to complete a quick task to prove they can follow through, the 1-3 people that actually follow through, I will hire.
A few questions. How long should these articles be? Also, you say to use spin syntax, I assume that it's OK it manually rewrite these articles as well, right?
For the manual web2.0 submissions, I need to use a unique article for each submission, correct?
Now, for steps 4, 5, and 6, do I need to use a unique article for each step, or can I blast the same article to all the blog networks, senuke 2.0, and amr blast? Should this article be unique from the others submitted to the manual 2.0s, or can it be a non-unique one?
A few questions. How long should these articles be? Also, you say to use spin syntax, I assume that it's OK it manually rewrite these articles as well, right?
I always make the articles at least 500 words in length, some longer. It would be ok to re-write the entire article as well,but this would take A LOT longer. And if you MANUALLY spin an article you end up with a decent article. Make sure they are at least 60% unique.

Yes, that is correct. Each time you submit an article to a web2.0 property, first spin a unique version of it. Remember to embed your YouTube video and add pictures.

If it's an easy, long tail keyword I simply use the same article. Thats why you need to make sure it is spun properly. I also write out at least 4 different titles, and then spin then all individually and spin them so it uses on of them randomly.
If it is a difficult keyword though, it's best to have a new article written for submission to these sites though...but you will also need to spin this new article - you NEVER EVER want the EXACT same article going to all these sites...it must always be at least 60% spun content...

Thank you for replying. You answered a lot a questions, but I would like if you could further help me to make sure I understand what you mean.
Referring to competing for a higher competition keyword that requires unique content:
4. Blog Networks. There are 8 Blog networks that I submit my Promo article to. Some may require you to remove the links from the body, and put them in a resource box instead. My article is submitted to the following networks: Article Blueprint, Distribute Your Articles, Blog Blueprint, Authority Link Network, Article Ranks, Free Traffic system, My Article Network and SEO Extreme. Are you saying that each of these networks get's a unique article, or just one unique submitted to each?
5. SenukeX Campaign: I then run an automated web2.0 campaign using SenukeX (“Social Network” Campaign in SenukeX). I use the same Promo article as content, with links in the article body. I DO NOT submit to the same sites I already submitted to manually (Those where the YouTube video was embedded). This normally gives me additional 25 or 26 properties with my article and links. Again, same questions, 1 Unique article used for the whole campaign, or 25 unique articles (1 for each property)?
6. Article Marketing Robot campaign. I have over 15k article directories in my AMR, just got the lists for free on the internet and added them as I got them. Out of these I successfully submit to about 1,500 sites and get about 300 to 400 which auto approve my article. In your post you indicate that you do 1 unique article to all of the sites (since there's no way you can efficiently spin 400 articles).
Also, while I'm at it, how long does it take you to manually spin the articles?
Do you purposely spread out each cycle over a week, or is that just for convenience? Would it hurt if you did the whole cycle in a day or 2?
Thank you for replying. You answered a lot a questions, but I would like if you could further help me to make sure I understand what you mean.
Referring to competing for a higher competition keyword that requires unique content:
Also, while I'm at it, how long does it take you to manually spin the articles?
Do you purposely spread out each cycle over a week, or is that just for convenience? Would it hurt if you did the whole cycle in a day or 2?
Thank you so much for clearing this up!
Hey bud,
Each time an article is submitted...a unique version of the article is submitted. The EXACT SAME article is never submitted to two sites. But, I don't write out unique versions of all these articles either. It's the same article, just spun into unique versions.
To ensure optimal quality of the article, I normally hand spin the article myself with the help of The Best Spinner. This normally takes anywhere from 20min to 45min - depending on the length of the article.
Then I give it to my outsourcing guys...each time they need a unique article...they simply click "New Spin" and a unique article is generated from the spun article. Same goes for the SenukeX campaigns...simply put the article in spin syntax in Senuke and the software will automatically spin a new version of it each time it makes a submission.
The only time I would use a second article in the same SEO cycle, is if im targeting a difficult keyword...then I would have a new article written for the AMR submission...but also submit it in spin syntax to the software, which will then submit unique versions of it to the article directories.
Yes,I did .I put the same content with my site. I get some traffic when they click links into PDF file. I create article about coupon product, and use wordpress plugin print PDF file and upload this PDF to Scribd and Docstoc.
This way help my article index very fast, but ranking less than them on Google.
So, how can I put content totally different ? Create other articles related with my target keyword and put to Web2.0 ?
Thanks for your reply !
Thank for GOOD strategy, very interesting !
Yeah but you running into problems with duplicate content there buddy...the articles on your site should be top notch, giving the user exactly what they searched for. The articles you write for PDF's etc must be totally different, and can just be about anything relating to your niche. The idea with them is only to get the link pointing to your site...

Thanks for the kind words buddy, but i definitely think you should read the post again...its got absolutely NOTHING to do with keyword research. It's actually a backlinking campaign to get your website pages to rank in Google...

Sincerely, Duc
Sent you a pm...
Please send me the same answers you sent to Duc, please. I have been purchasing a LOT of services for the last 3 weeks. I was glad to find your post. Very USEFUL to me. It is time for me to learn this stuff. I noticed that the WSO's I have aren't even half as intense as your SEO method. Definitely going to push my first "Thanks".
Pair this with a "little" authority site (a site which is well structured with categories, tags etc.)...you will be able to rank high for almost any keyword for sure.
Edit:
I want to add some more. If you do such complex campaigns with a LARGE number of links, you MUST make sure to vary your anchor texts.
--> Do not use only your "keyword" as anchor texts, use your keyword and one or two closely related keyword(s) in maybe 50% of your anchors, but DO NOT BE AFRAID to use blank URLS and also words like "here" etc. as anchor texts.
Do not make the mistake and blast 10.000 links which all have a keyword, this might back-fire.
--> If you submit your articles with Senuke and the various blog networks, don't hesitate to ALSO link to authority sites and other related sites together with YOUR link in your article. It is my personal "belief" that such links are stronger and it also looks more natural if a link comes with other, related links. The fact that you also link to wkipedia etc. does NOT make your link "weaker".
The same applies to bookmarks. When you bookmark, don't hesitate to make your bookmarking account look natural. Link to the latest news on the web, whatever everyone is talking about...AND your sites. Don't just "spoil" a bookmarking account by linking only to your own sites.

Thanks buddy, some great input here...and i totally agree. I'll be honest though, my anchor text is always either my target keyword or an LSI keyword.
With regards to linking to other sites, i TOTALLY agree with this. ESPECIALLY if you link to some authority sites...The same goes for the actual content on your website, give the searcher EXACTLY what they are looking for, and sometimes that even means giving them a link of another site...so be it...
Excellent post Nick, thanks for taking the time to share your in-depth strategy. I have one question for you on the subject of Scribd. I noticed this is part of your submission strategy and I am keen to submit some PPT's and PDF's to Scribd but they seem to be very anti-marketing. I just looked at their terms, which includes these lines:
What isn't permitted?
You may not sell access to Scribd's related services (such as the embeddable document reader) on another website without prior agreement from Scribd.
You may not use Scribd or its related services (such as the embeddable document reader) for the primary purpose of gaining advertising or subscription revenue.
You may not publish or link to anything that promotes or facilitates the following (irrelevant items omitted):
affiliate marketing topics;
search engine optimization;
I'd be really interest to hear your take on this. Does that mean pretty much anything "make money online" related is out? I have a wiki site based around internet marketing so I wonder if I can make use of Scribd or not. Their rules seem to exclude so much.

Hey bud,
I'll be DEAD honest with you here, I have not really read any of the web2.0 properties' terms....!
I have also not had any "make money" niches that I've targeted...so i dont really know if that would be a problem? I think your best bet would be to create one or two PDF's and submit it to Scribd, then maybe get in touch with their support and find out if your documents are in line with their terms.
I have never had any documents removed or accounts banned...but then again, as i said i have never targeted "make money" niches.
To be honest though, I think they would only really have a problem if your content is blatantly promoting your site. The content I put out always looks very professional, even though it's only a spin off of my promo article. I always include a professional cover page, plenty of relevant pictures and my link is always "naturally" placed in the content and relevant to what the reader is reading.
Hope this helps. In fact, if you find out about this it would be great if you could post your findings here for us all to know, as im curious about this now as well...thanks!

Same here. As long as you add decent content to the property, generally, you can insert a link or two, again, as long as you are adding value to the community, pretty much like anything...
Really appreciate you taking the time to share your strategy. I think this is a very good strategy to incorporate into what I'm already doing and an excellent way to learn more about SEO and other alternative sources for traffic.
@WikiWarrior, I would also like to know what you find out about the Scribd issue and MMO.
This is an excellent post! I may have to outsource this and compare it to my current SEO results. Thanks for the share!
Thanks buddy, and that will be great. As i said earlier, get back to this thread and let us all know the kind of results you are getting...especially compared to your own SEO strategy (maybe we can swap notes ) - I'm always keen to expand my own strategy or try new things...so will be interesting to read your results...

you have really explained great things to rank high in google SERP, but i create a blog and get it on the first page of google within a week..just collect ten to 15 high pr backlinks and all free..i do not find any use of these software program.. most of my blogger blogs on first page of google(some have 1st ranking and get around 100 daily unique visits)
I have NO doubt that this works, but implementing it looks expensive. Between SeNukeX, 8 private blog networks, Scrapebox, spinning software, Article Marketing Robot and virtual assistants to out-source to, we're talking serious money. Is it safe to assume you're going after some super high profit keywords to be putting in this much effort and only doing 2-3 cycles/week??
I think if anyone want to get keyword ranking then from starting, from at the time of choice of keyword one has to be aware in choice of keyword and have to choose such which used more by people as per their need in your field. And then after the first step of choice of keyword, you need to provide better content with targeting that keyword. And then measure your results, you definitely get the better ranking for your keyword.

This could be done a lot cheaper...most of the tasks could be individually outsourced to Fiverr for $5 a piece.
And im doing 2 to 3 cycles a weeks PER VA ;-)

Thanks.
I would highly recommend NOT doing that though. I never have any single VA knowing my entire cycle.
I always have at least two or three different guys working on the same cycle. One guy does the content, the other the manual account creation and some submissions, and another would do the rest of the submissions and the social bookmarking.
Then all the strengthening link stuff, and AMR submisison I always do myself.
I may just be too paranoid...but since these guys are already doing all the work, whats to stop them from quitting to work for me and simply doing it for themselves?
I used market samurai to analyse the top 10 - mostly PR 2 and 3 pages. Mostly authority sites that are 5 years plus in age. Most PAGES have little backlinks though...we looking at under 500...except for two sites that have over 2,000...NONE of the sites have .Edu or .Gov links.
5 of the sites are listed in Yahoo Dir and Dmoz. Onsite opimization is not great, but there is some.
About my site:
I bought an exact match domain...and added one 700 word article to the site with some pics. And also a Contact us page and a Privacy policy page...nothing else.
I built a sitemap and submitted to Google webmaster tools, and added Google analytics and statcounter code.
The site is built on a wordpress platform.
The site build, contact page, and privacy policy page was done 3 days ago. And yesterday when i checked the site was already indexed in Google...(With no backlinking whatsoever) If it was not, a simple social bookmarking campaign would get it indexed
Ok so i thought it would be a good idea to show you guys how quickly and easily this method works.
About the keyword:
I selected a long tail keyword in the baby/pregnancy niche...this keyword consists of 4 words
It gets 4,400 monthly searches according to the Google keyword tool
About the competition:

hi I noticed you mentioned you target a long tail keyword of four words or more. what do you think about targeting a short tail keyword, say of about 2 words. For instance. I have a site a bout vacuum cleaners. Am I in for a real difficult time if I want to target a keyword like "vaccuum cleaner reviews" or like "portable vacuums"

Normally the more difficult (shorter) keywords have all the authority sites ranking in the top 10 positions...It can definitely be done, but you are going to need a lot more time, money and effort. You would require more cycles,and be constantly updating your site with new, fresh content.
I had a quick look at the competition for "vacuum cleaner reviews" and "portable vacuums"...
"Vacuum cleaner reviews" actually looks like quite an easy keyword to target. Fresh content and a solid cycle should get you on the first page at least. Top 3 might be a little more challenging though...
"portable vacuums" is the same story. Should be fairly quick to get on the first page...judging by the competition, at least position 8...but again, it might take a little more time and effort to get to the top 3. AND because this is a much shorter, more general keyword I have no idea how long you would actually stay on the first page. As new competitors enter the market they might bump you off...
In the end of the day, you are going to have to calculate what page 1 rankings for these keywords are worth to you...then you can create an effective and profitable budget...
I found this thread since last week but just have a chance to finished reading it today. Thanks for still stay with us.
I have one question. You seem to emphasis on embeding the video and also some pictures in web2.0 . Why? Also, wonder if it necessary to use different pictures in each post?
Embedding the video gives the content an extra element of "quality" so does the picture. Everyone else is building links by simply submitting a "dry" article to web2.0 properties...our links are in higher quality content.
Also, by having the video embedded, each time someone visits a web2.0 property and watches the video it increases the views on the video helping it get more views on YouTube as well...over time this helps bring in a bit more traffic as well

Yes i run the "social network" campaign for my money site, then I use the social bookmarking, ping, and RSS directories to help strengthen the links ive been building with other sources
In my opinion any link building software can put your money site at risk if you use it like an idiot! But use them in combination with other methods, and keep the link velocity and link diversity going and you will see excellent results

I do all my SEO in cycles - as in the opening post. So i use Senuke for individual campaigns each day to help complete the cycles.
Do not include links in your content body for AMR blasts. They need to be in a resource box. I normally include two keywords in my resource box - one to my site (target keyword as anchor text) and the other to a random URL of the manual web2.0 sites, including the Docstoc, SlideShare, Scribd and YouTube URL's or an inner page of your site. This can all be randomized using spin syntax.
Results: I was on page 1 ranked #8 yesterday on google, and today my keyword is no longer in the top 300... in fact i can't even find it! I googled the exact URL that i was marketing, and it still appears in google search. Not sure what happened, hopefully I have not been Sandboxed.
Lessons Learned: SENuke is a spammy deceptive software and I would not use it again. The quality it turns out is extremely poor. SENuke blasts may also result in a virus being passed to you.
Specifically: Social Nuke - really poor quality, not even worth doing. I had much more success creating my sites manually.
Social Bookmarking Nuke - Success rate is low. I would rather go through Fiverr for this or do this manually via SocialMarker only to the top social bookmarking sites like digg, delicious, reddit, etc.
Pinger - Pinger Nuke is good, but you can do this for free on PingFarm.com
RSS Submission - Had the highest success rate with this, but there are free versions out there.
-----
What I would continue to do: Create manual web 2.0 properties, but a more complex linkage system with multiple nodes. I would use sites like tripod.lycos.com, weebly, livejournal, webnode, yola, xanga, wikispaces, wordpress, edublogs, thoughts, beep, webs, zimbio, and jimdo. Scribd and slideshare.net will also be linked.
I will create a youtube channel for that specific URL i am targetting, and upload a video to it. This way you control the video and you get double the link juice. I would also include Vimeo.
I would use Fiverr for 2 blog blasts, AMR + Blog .
Blueprint.
I woul use Pingfarm for mass pinging, double back on it by using pingomatic, and use ****2RSS to create rss feeds.

Thank you SO MUCH for coming back and posting your results (even if they may not be favorable)..it's honest, clear posts like this that help others learn and develop their own view on things.
I do however have a few things to say regarding your results. Please note, i am in no way trying to defend my strategy here...as ive always said SEO is not an exact science and we all need to do what we feel will work for ourselves.
Firstly, you might simply be involved in the Google dance...as you know this is very common...you might be pleasantly surprised in a day or two if you show up again in a better position. Then again, as you mentioned, you may well be sandboxed. But in either case, your best option would be to keep building links...
Secondly, as for SenukeX not working well for you. You are obviously entitled to your opinion and in no way am i trying to change that. I just want to inform you of why i use SenukeX. You might just need to give it some more time to learn the software a bit better.
The only time senukex will give you "spammy" results is if the seed content you feed it is spammy. But give it a well written, well HAND-SPUN article and every submission it makes to the web2.0 properties will be perfectly legible, unique from the last and good quality. Use the automatically scraped and spun articles from within senukex..and you end up with spammy results.
As for your success rates being low, this does happen from time to time depending on when last the senukex team last updated the software - but they pretty good on this point. The only other reason you could be getting poor results is because you were using bad proxies - or too few proxies. I always use private, unshared proxies...
Now the reason i use SenukeX is because, firstly i get pretty decent results (for the most part). And secondly it gives me more diversity with my links when it submits my article to more web20's. And most of the web2.0's on senukex dont get the video embedded like the manual web2.0's - so the content varies a little too.
Anyway, Thanks again for posting your results. In the end i am an avid believer of developing an SEO strategy that works for you personally. And by the sounds of it, thats exactly what you are busy doing - testing, learning and adjusting your strategy along the way. So good on ya!
Hi Nick,
thanks for this great post. Thanks for sharing all the details on your campaign strategy. Would you mind to give some recommendations on outsourcing?

Thanks guys, hope it helps some of you out...
As for outsourcing, it's best to go with a company that specializes in Virtual Assistants. Search google for "seo virtual assistant philippines" or similar...I prefer working with guys in the philippines...cheap and they always eager to please.
You can get a full time VA working 5 days a week for you for anywhere between $300 and $800 a month...If you cannot afford it, it might be worth outsourcing the individual tasks to fiverr or similar...
Nice to read your post and great strategy. I'm just starting out for now and have got 2 sites built to date with another 10 planned for this year.
When researching the niche with market samurai, google trends etc, I have used the following:
(i) low average PR competing pages of <2
(ii) traffic recommendation is minimum SEO Traffic 80 per day.
(iii) moderate exact searches per month (preferably 4k+), and
(iv) around 20k all in title and all in url quote competition.
(v) adwords CPC of minimum $0.80
Is the above appropriate? Please advise from your experience how I can use market samurai effectively to enter into niche markets. I have several written down, just not sure how to assess and pick the right ones.

This seems like good criteria...but you in the end the ONLY thing thats going to work is for YOU to test and see what works. If you are battling to rank your pages, either add better content or select easier keywords. But the criteria you have mentioned above would be fairly easy to rank for...BUT you did not look at the amount and quality of your competitors backlinks or their on page optimization.
The way I personally do it, is to totally forget about number of competing pages etc... (I have had keywords with well over 250k "in quote" competing pages rank within a week!)
i simply look at who is currently in the top 10 positions, for a normal (non-quoted search) of my keyword. Then I analyze the PAGES (NOT Domain) that is ranking. And i decide if i would be able to do better than any of them.
Generally these are the criteria I personally look at:
1. PR of pages - majority should be 2 and under - none over 3
2. Number of backlinks for the PAGE (not the domain) - anything under 500 is pretty good
3. .Edu or .Gov backlinks - preferably 0 - but if one or two pages have a couple thats ok. But I dont want all the pages to have 10+ if you get my drift
4. Dmoz and YDir listing - Again preferably none! If 2 or 3 sites are listed id still consider it. But their listing here is normally a sign that they are considered authority sites
5. Onsite optimization - generally I prefer to target keywords where the competition are not well optimized. If a page is 100% well optimized, id check it's links etc... to get a better idea of what id need to do to over throw them.
I also look at the sites that are ranking...videos, article directories or any other web 2.0's are generally a sign that the keyword will be very easy to rank for
I do not care about site age either...ive created free blogger blogs with a single article on it that ranks number 2..all my competitors are older than 8 years!!
But again, this sort of thing is personal preference and i dont think there are really any set-in-stone type of rules. Just go with what you have, and test till you find what works best for you.
i simply look at who is currently in the top 10 positions, for a normal (non-quoted search) of my keyword. Then I analyze the PAGES (NOT Domain) that is ranking. And i decide if i would be able to do better than any of them.
This is SO golden. I cannot stress enough how important this is. Ever since I learnt this tip a couple months back, the figurative "mist" has cleared from my eyes and I am started to rank for some awesome keywords. I would have seriously paid someone $200+ to give me this piece of info when I first started...
Just a little more steps, use a tool like market samurai (or ahrefs) to check out the top 10 sites anchor text. If you are trying to rank for "weight loss for teenagers" and you find that the top couple spots have a couple hundred links targeting this exact keyword, then move on (unless you want to work on a long term plan of course) Seriously, forget about the rest of the search engine results, just analyse the top 10.
Generally these are the criteria I personally look at:
1. PR of pages - majority should be 2 and under - none over 3
2. Number of backlinks for the PAGE (not the domain) - anything under 500 is pretty good
3. .Edu or .Gov backlinks - preferably 0 - but if one or two pages have a couple thats ok. But I dont want all the pages to have 10+ if you get my drift
4. Dmoz and YDir listing - Again preferably none! If 2 or 3 sites are listed id still consider it. But their listing here is normally a sign that they are considered authority sites
5. Onsite optimization - generally I prefer to target keywords where the competition are not well optimized. If a page is 100% well optimized, id check it's links etc... to get a better idea of what id need to do to over throw them.
I also look at the sites that are ranking...videos, article directories or any other web 2.0's are generally a sign that the keyword will be very easy to rank for

Hope this helps
I'm kind of the other way on this one. If I see authority sites rocking the first page but are poorly optimized, then I will go after the term as chances are I'll be able to grab one of the first 5 spots on the first page. I love seeing results where YouTube, Wikipedia, News Sites or any authority sites are ranking.
I especially love to see a YouTube video at the top of the page, they're extremely easy to outrank and what a lot of people don't realize, is that if you can get your YT video to rank on the first page with your web pages backlink in the description and well optimized for your KW with your video embedded in your websites page as well, then there is a very good chance that if you rank your video, you'll also rank your webpage for the same term sealing two positions on the first page.
You answered it perfectly. You see, I'm new new to spinning and did not know that you could create a spin syntax and set SenukeX and AMR to submit a different spin to every article directory and every web 2.0. Now I understand after reading the following:
....Same goes for the SenukeX campaigns...simply put the article in spin syntax in Senuke and the software will automatically spin a new version of it each time it makes a submission......AMR submission...but also submit it in spin syntax to the software, which will then submit unique versions of it to the article directories.
I think we've got everything cleared up (at least for now, lol.)!
Also, thanks for doing a case-study as well. I was just thinking that this would be a fun thing to do with this method.
Ok so our case study is off to a really rocky start...the VA I had working on this cycle yesterday, got ill half way through the day and was sent home...a fact that I only found out about this morning!
So, the only work actually completed yesterday was the AMR blast...
The SenukeX and the Manual Web2.0 campaigns will only be completed today.
So before we even really got started we are already an entire day behind! But unfortunately these things happen, and we will have to deal with it - hence the Sat work!

Results so far: Checked the site this morning and it moved up to position 289.
Obviously I was not expecting any fantastic results, as it's only been one day and no real link building has been done.
EDIT: I also just wanted to let you guys know, I have added one video to the site. Nothing special...just a random YouTube video on the topic, and simply embedded it in the article
I love reading case studies and yours looks fantastic! So much information and so detailed, thank you for all the time that you are putting into this and for sharing with us.
I also have 3 blogs that I'm working on right now. The bad part about all of them is that I've started to work on all of them almost half a year ago and kind of forgotten about them until about 2 weeks ago. My hosting was also closed due to the fact that I didn't pay for it, therefore one of my sites some of my pages which had PR of 2, 3 and even 4 now all have PR 0..., while other site has gained PR from 0 to 2 and 3. I think its funny, but I don't know what happened there.
Right now I'm trying to figure out what to do with them. All of them have some backlinking done, mostly social bookmarking of pages and home page. One of them, that has PR 2-3, has over 2k backlinks. When I was building this site (its a wordpress blog with 5 articles and a few videos and pics) I paid for some backlinking services and I guess now I'm seeing some results. I actually have 2 of my kws on page 1, ranking 1 and 2, but the funny part is I have no traffic whatsoever, still trying to figure out what is going on with that.
After reading your posts I think what I will do is I will definitely join one of the blog networks, then I will submit spun versions of one of my article to article directories don't have AMR so will have to do it manually for now, probably will choose around 10 for now and see how it goes), create more Web 2.0 profiles and submit articles to them, social bookmark all the links, create RSS feeds, submit them to RSS aggregators and ping. Don't know how to create videos yet, but I will work on them this month.
I know that my post is a mess but I got motivated after I read your case study and just wanted to share some things that I have on my plate right now. I will probably do my own case study on my blog and will share it later to let you know how I'm doing. Thank you again for your great input!

Great stuff! Would love to see a case study from you as well...I think the biggest secret in this industry is consistency! Stick to it and you will definitely see SOME kind of results SOMEWHERE!
As for videos, check out Animoto.com - thats what i use

Thanks bud...and if what you do works for you, then why change it right! As we all know, SEO is not an exact science and if you can get results with less effort then why not!

Hey Nick,
I totally agree on consistency part. I have been lacking that for the past few months, hopefully I'll be doing better now.
Also about the videos, its not that I don't have tools, if I need to I can get them, but the reason I don't like to make videos is because of the content. The sites I have right now are the following. One is based on amazon product reviews, another has just one product for review and third one is adsense based site. Because I don't really have physical products on hand, that's the reason I don't like doing videos as I don't know what would I show in those videos.
Did you ever do videos for adsens based or amazon review sites? Any ideas as to how to make videos for those sites? Appreciate anything that you can give me. Thanks
Ok guys i've been getting a lot of PM's lately about outsourcing. I don't feel i recommend any specific company without being biased. So here are a few tips.
1. If you can afford it, hire a full time Virtual Assistant (VA) - ideally from the Philippines. This will cost you between $400 and $800 a month. Train them well and never let a single VA know your entire seo cycle.
2. To find a company offering VA's - simply search google for "SEO VA philippines" or similar. There are plenty companies that offer VA's of this type. It will also be useful if you can get a VA that has some training in SEO and has some SEO tools available to him - this saves you from needing to buy these tools yourself
3. Avoid using odesk or similar - some of these guys may have the same hourly rate, but they work from home. They are not in an office with someone to supervise them (As with a VA from a company). So generally they tend to be less productive
4. DO NOT give the individual tasks to freelancers to do on a once-off basis. Firstly it will cost you a fortune - they charge $30 to $40 JUST for the manual web2.0 submission! AND they are not trained by you, doing it everyday, so they are VERY unproductive with your time...Small mistakes can be VERY COSTLY Time-wise
5. If you really cannot afford help, it may be worth turning to Fiverr to help you complete the labour-intensive work. But again, this must be seen only as a way to HELP you complete the cycles - to outsource everything to Fiverr may also be quite costly/cycle
6. DON'T be afraid to do some work yourself! Even today still with a whole team of VA's to help me, i still do some of the cycle work myself. They just take care of all the tedious boring stuff. Do not expect to get a VA and just drop the entire SEO cycle into their lap - you will be disappointed!
I got caught up yesterday with other work, and did not have time to complete the quick social bookmakarking of the AMR campaign. Also my VA didn't have time to complete the the entire Thorough social bookmarking campaign - this will be completed on monday.
I know I said i was going to complete these tasks today - but i totally forgot it's my girlfriends birthday...And i dont think she will appreciate it too much if im in my office working all day on her special day! So im rather going to spend some quality time with her today and complete the work on monday.
Results so far: Checked the site this morning, and it has moved up to position 23
This is not bad, especially considering we have only been working on links for about 3 days. BUT with this type of keyword i really was expecting it to be closer to the top 10 by this stage...I think it may be bit more of a struggle because the competing pages are fairly large authorities in the niche...
It may be a little early to tell, and still got to do the Google dance, but I think one more SEO Cycle and we will be where we need to be for this site. IF we are VERY lucky, after this cycle is completed we may be placed in the top 10...
Moving Forward: For now I just want to fully complete this first cycle for the site, and give it a couple of days to give chance for the Google dance and to see where we floating around.
Once this cycle is completed, im going to add another Youtube video to the article and maybe some additional pictures with paragraph-long descriptions. The reason for this is I want google to see a constantly updated page while deciding on where to place me in the rankings.
If by thursday or so next week we are still not in the top 10 I will commence a second SEO cycle for this site...
This is a nice twist strategy you got there pal. Good thing that you shared this, because its another goldmine that SEO specialists and internet marketers are looking for. Well, since this is so effective I might give this a shot....and to my friend as well.

Yeah, glad i could have helped. Sad thing is, many internet marketers will not put this to practice. But for those of you that do,you will definitely see some great results.
Will be great if you get back to the thread with some results...will make for an interesting read..
I was actually NOT going to post an update today as it's Sunday...but i just could not help myself...
Results so far: This morning I checked my site and I had started receiving like 3 or 4 unique visitors...So i checked the ranking and it has moved up to position 14...
The site is also now ranked position 377 for a very broad term in the same niche...
This is great news, as it means We might even hit the first page just by completing the first SEO cycle...
Strategy for the site stays the same...on monday we will complete the SEO cycle, add some additional pics and a youtube video embed...then wait till thursday to see where we stand. At that point, I will decide whether or not to start on a second cycle..
I'm kind of the other way on this one. If I see authority sites rocking the first page but are poorly optimized, then I will go after the term as chances are I'll be able to grab one of the first 5 spots on the first page. I love seeing results where YouTube, Wikipedia, News Sites or any authority sites are ranking.
I especially love to see a YouTube video at the top of the page, they're extremely easy to outrank and what a lot of people don't realize, is that if you can get your YT video to rank on the first page with your web pages backlink in the description and well optimized for your KW with your video embedded in your websites page as well, then there is a very good chance that if you rank your video, you'll also rank your webpage for the same term sealing two positions on the first page.
By authority sites I don't mean YouTube...YouTube videos would fall in the same category as Web2.0's (for me anyway)...By authority sites I mean sites that have a couple hundred pages at least of content, they are well aged, high pr...just a general "authority" in the niche...this is especially true when the page ranking is highly optimized for the keyword. I'm not saying you can not outrank them...im just saying it's normally a sign of a difficult keyword and a long struggle ahead of you to get to the top..
But I do agree with you on the YouTube videos though...very easy to outrank...sames goes for any article directory pages, EMD "sniper-type" sites, web2.0's like blogger, wordpress.com, weebly, squidoo etc etc...
News sites on the other hand I don't even bother trying to outrank. If I see a term where the top 5 competitors are CNN, Fox etc... i stay FAR AWAY.

But when we used duplicate content, we had great difficulty getting anywhere with the rankings. And whats more, when eventually we did start building proper links to these pages...it STILL took ages to get them ranked. It's as if the duplicate content links destroyed the site's "reputation" or something..

You can get the urls by right clicking on the list of directories and selecting "Live Links". Than save the file.
Thank you very much for this post!I will try it to my next site and i hope to have the same results
Yeah please come back and post your results, will be great to see

Yes, but for different sites. Normally I'd complete one full cycle for a site, then give it a few days to see where it lays in the SERP's. If necessary I'll start another cycle for that site.
There is not much maintenance to be done once you have got the rankings. Most of my sites are well over a year old and still going strong, without any additional effort from myself.
If you were targeting a very difficult keyword, with loads of competition, this might be a different story though. And you might need to constantly add new content to your site, and run the odd cycle to keep it up in the SERPS..
But for regular medium to easy keywords, i literally just run SEO Cycles until I got the ranking I want...then stop..and move onto the next project...

Thanks, and the only "cheaper" alternative i could think of is to pay someone who has the tools to do it for you. Check out Fiverr...

Great share! What I like about this is its very straight to the point and it does not add some more mumbo jumbo. You are told what to do and how to do it. Plus it also comes with a matching case study.
Nick, Thanks for sharing such detailed information. It is easy to see that your SEO efforts are covering all the bases. The case for outsourcing is made. It is going to be time consuming but I will be incorporating some of your methods into my work. Thanks

Thanks guys, makes it all worth it if it truly helps some of you. If any of you put this to work for yourselves, come back and post your results here...we would all love to read about it!
What was done today:
1. 2 new pics added to my site, each with a paragraph-long description. 2. Thorough social bookmarking campaign completed 3. RSS feeds created, submitted and pinged 4. Quick Social bookmarking campaign of AMR urls 5. ScrapeBox blast is running as I type this...will be complete in a couple of hours
This marks the end of one full SEO cycle.
Moving Forward: As I mentioned before, all I want to do now is give this site a few days and see what it does in the SERP's. On thursday if I'm not happy with the ranking I might start a second SEO Cycle..
The Results: First thing this morning I checked and I was NO WHERE in the TOP 500!!
Checked at about lunch time and I had moved into position 10 (YEAH! First page!)
I checked now just before posting this update, and I had moved up to position 8 for my main target keyword and from position 377 to position 20 for a very general broad term in the niche.
So I think it's safe to say i am officially engaged in the all-popular Google dance! The big question now, is where am i going to be placed when the dust settles?
For my main target keyword (The longtail one) I think I will settle in the top 10 after the cycle has completed and left to stand for a few days. If i wanted to rank for the broad term (currently #20), I think I would need at least one or two additional cycles concentrating on only on that keyword.
Through all the ups and downs of the Google dance today, the site managed to get 12 unique visitors!
My Views: All in all I am happy with the results so far. If you consider, only 4 days ago the content was first added to the site, and the SEO cycle officially began...AND we had a day delay because my VA was unexpectedly ill...
And now, only 4 days later the site is already hovering on the first page (Albeit in the google dance). This alone SHOULD give you guys some idea of how powerful this SEO strategy REALLY is!
Don't be lazy, put it to work for yourself and you will be seeing similar results...
Will try it out, what happens after the months though, do you see a dignificant drop or gradual decline?
For easy to medium keywords I have never really seen a drop or decline. In fact, some of the sites even got better rankings with time...i think this is because other people naturally started linking back to my site on their own.
There are a few exceptions to this though. Where very difficult, broad keywords were targeted I would sometimes see I gradual decline in rank, but an additional cycle every few months would bring it right back up.
Many times I sell the site once I've had it for a few months..

May I ask what you are using to track the movements of your keywords?
Hey Nick,
Nice strategy, I do some things similar, particularly with the blog networks. I also use backlinks energizer to boost all my links instead of going through the hassle of creating RSS feeds, it's a great plugin, and a massive time saver, you should give it a try if you haven't already.
I have AMR, but have not been using it much. You say you do AMR blasts, so you're blasting one article out to over 1,500 article directories and getting all your links? or are you adding spin syntax in the article in order for AMR to automatically spin for each submission? Just wondering, because otherwise does this not count as 300-400 links with duplicate content?
Also, you say you can do a couple of cycles a week. i am assuming you do not follow this strategy for new sites? Surely Google is not going to favour you for blasting that many links at a brand new site?
Hey man, first off great post I appreciate all the time and effort you put into helping the community. Straight up!
I have a few questions, please bear with me I'm still kinda sorta new to this.
When you mention in step 2 at the end of number 1 to add two links to the article, can we just add one link?
I'm asking because you mentioned one goes to a link to the homepage and one to the page that's targeting the keywords.. on my sites I only have the homepage, contact us, and the posts page. And then like 10 posts.
Or do I link a post using that posts kw as anchor plus another anchor using the homepages kw?
Next I'm wondering what you mean @ step 3 right before number 1 you state to copy each pages url that you create into a text document.
Thanks! I am going to try this out on my sites since I have not been able to come up with a plan.
Nice post Nick thanks for sharing. Would you mind sharing where you got the AMR list?
I can't remember the exact place. I literally just searched google for it. I got various lists of directories and imported them all into AMR.
AMR will automaticall add it to its list if its a directory it can submit to...else it will ignore it if its already in the list or if its not supported.

Either way, nice post mate.
Thanks bud. With regards to AMR, I use the article in spin syntax, spun to at least 50% to 60% unqiue. I do this manually with the help of The Best Spinner. So there's no real worry of duplicate content here..also I blast the article immediately to all available directories..i never "drip feed" anything.
And you wrong about not wanting to use this strategy for a new site bud. Read the case posts I made above. It was a brand new site, and within 4 days got it ranked in position 8 with only one cycle.
I have never had any of my sites sandboxed, or penalized in any way using this strategy - even brand new sites. The only thing i do is make sure the site is indexed in Google before running a cycle.

hey and thanks.
Yes you can simply add one link if you wish. But what id do instead is add two links to the same page using different anchor texts. Maybe use an LSI keyword for the other.
You could also just use the other link to randomly link to one of your other web2.0 properties already done. Like the YouTube video, Weebly page etc...
The only reason i say to add each page's URL into a text document, is because if you follow the cycle - you will need the urls later on in the cycle. For example, after creating the manual web2.0 properties, you need those URL's when doing a social bookmarking campaign to them, or when adding them to an rss feed...it's simply to make it easier for you down the road...
Could you elaborate more on this? How do you use them, in what way? That is, what do you use them for? Have you ever noticed any difference between using them and not using them?
Thanks for expounding upon this a bit more.
I use private proxies for creating accounts and submitting content to the sites. I also use CCLEANER to clear the computer's cache and history each time before creating new accounts.
The reason I use them is so that the sites i constantly submit content to (under various accounts) dont see that there are 500 accounts all from the same IP address - they will simply ban all the accounts associated with the same ip and ill lose ALL my backlinks.
Also, when using software like SenukeX it's essential to use your own private proxies else your success rate is really low...
Is there anyway that you can post a market samuri screenshot (or seoquake) of the SEO analysis for the competition on the first page?
I'm interested to see the pagerank, age, and links of the sites that you are competing with to get top 10 rankings so quickly.
If you do so, of course you can blur out all the information so that we don't see the exact phrases that you are working on.
Yeah sure bud, Don't know why i didn't think of this before! I should have actually included pics in each case study update...might do a another REAL LIVE case study for you guys like this - without hiding my site and niche...
Below is a screenshot taken from Market Samurai..this was the saved data already in the project - so this is the data BEFORE I got my site in the top 10. This is the exact information I used to base my decision on...
CASE STUDY UPDATE:
The site is still strongly in position 8 for the main keyword and position 20 for the broad keyword. The site received 39 unique visitors yesterday. I think if we can get this site into the top 3 it will receive over 100 unique visitors a day...(or 3,000 a month). This level can easily be reached by running another cycle...i.e within 2 weeks from site creation!
It might also be worth mentioning,i have not seen ANY movement on the ranking since it hit the number 8 spot. No dance no nothing...which is a little weird actually...and it does not look like the site wants to move up any further either...
But we will stick to the plan, and on thursday i will check on the ranking and decide whether or not to run another cycle...
Sorry if this isn't a good post or if it's been answered... I'm sure I could probably find the answer somewhere, but when you say spun to atleast 50% uniqueness what exactly does that mean and how do I check that. That's the main part I'm confused about.
Also, in regards to the youtube video. Should the youtube video be targeting our keyword or no?
When we say 50% unique, it means that each new version must be about 50% unique from the previous. If you use software like The Best spinner, Magic Article Re-writer or even Spinner Chief, then your will be able to see how unique the article is as you add spintax to it.
With regards to the video, I dont normally target the same keyword in the video. The same with the promo article and PDF and slide show. I just make all the content about something RELATING to the niche. The thing is, you dont want these web2.0 properties to be competing with your own site.

thanks and amazing post and case study, im going to use your method!!!
In one cycle, the promo article gets submitted to all blog networks simultaneously and to go out immediately.
I use private proxies for creating accounts and submitting content to the sites. I also use CCLEANER to clear the computer's cache and history each time before creating new accounts.
The reason I use them is so that the sites i constantly submit content to (under various accounts) dont see that there are 500 accounts all from the same IP address - they will simply ban all the accounts associated with the same ip and ill lose ALL my backlinks.
Also, when using software like SenukeX it's essential to use your own private proxies else your success rate is really low...
Nick can you elaborate a bit more on your proxy usage? I think this is one thing that a lot of beginners struggle with. Do you buy 1 private proxy per site, and switch to that proxy whenever you are working on that site (i.e. running a cycle)?
Damn I still have so much to learn, hope that I can learn from your post and better my self in this area. Gotta love linkbuilding lol
Well you are at the right place

They have all kinds of software tool, like xrumer rank builder sick submitter. its a great place to get tools to help with your marketing.
Yeah but illegal. In my view, if the software serves you well, then pay the developers their due. Especially with something like Senuke, the developers put a lot of time and money in keeping it updated.
If I were you, shoot to make that $147 pm to pay for it properly...
No one can build a sustainable business with the mind set of stealing what you can

I do not use one proxy per site. If i use a proxy for SITE A...there's absolutely no reason I cant use that same proxy for SITE B as well.
SITE A and SITE B do not share information with each other regarding their user's ip addresses etc...(usually - Google, YouTube, Blogger is a different story)
So generally what I do, is have a bunch of proxies - maybe 20 or 30 - and simply rotate them. So I'll use the first proxy to create all the accounts and complete a cycle, then ill move onto the second proxy to complete the next cycle...etc...
By the time I get back to the first proxy, the site's its being used on have long forgotten that an account was created on it a week before. Well maybe not "forgotten", but it does not raise any red flags, because its not 30 accounts that all got created in 5 min under the same IP address.
This is also why i use CCLEANER in between account creations. Because it clears all internet cache and temporary internet files...meaning that there is no way a site can determine that its the same person that created two different accounts - different ip addresses (proxies) and no cache from previous logins etc...
The only thing that could really link accounts is a footprint in usenames, passwords etc...So be sure to use unique usernames, passwords, emails etc...You can use fakenamegenerator.com for ideas
When using software like SenukeX or AMR, simply add all the proxies in the software, and it will randomly use one of the proxies each time its doing something.
Using proxies in this way you can go a long way with only a few proxies. But generally I get myself a new batch of proxies every month anyway. A lot of the proxy services will allow you to request new proxies once a month or so.
I was curious: Do you only try to rank the homepage for your main keyword, or do you try to rank a subpage?
More importantly, do you find that it is harder to rank a subpage than the homepage? (because it sure seems that way).
Also, another important question: Do you use brand new domains with the keyword in the domain (not EMD but keyword in domain)? Or do you use AGED domains with existing PR??
How long before you get in the top 5 on page 1 and actually STAY there? 1-3 months?
Thanks for such a great post! You got my "thanks"
So far the strategy has worked great in the midst of Panda, lets just hope it stays that way!
Normally I try to rank an inner page. But most of the cycles will target the inner page im trying to rank for, and then the home page as well with it's main keyword. This means that their are constantly links being built to the main url as well as the inner pages - but because im always targeting the main url, its got a lot more links than the inner pages - this makes the site's linking structure look a lot more natural.
I personally find it a lot easier to rank an inner page. If you are targeting an easy keyword, and have quality content, it does not take much to rank.
I always use brand new domains - I never know what kind of penalties an aged domain has already collected along the way. As for keyword usage in the domain, it all depends on my goal with the site.
If its a small niche site with 10 to 15 pages of content, then normally the main keyword is at least in the domain name. If it's a micro niche site, i shoot for EMD or at least the keyword in the domain. If it's a larger authority type site with a lot of pages of content, I go for any name that is easy to remember
I am not able to give you a general guideline as to how long it takes to get a page in the top 5 - there are waaaay too many variables that affect this. The most important being the quality of content on your page, the difficulty of your keyword, how well your page is optimized and the quality of your cycle.
If all is done well, and its an easy keyword you could be in the top 5 within a week and after 1 cycle - or it may be a difficult keyword and could take 3 months with 15 cycles....it all depends on all the variables.
Earlier in this thread I did a case study site - I got it in the top 10 within 4 days, its never moved from there. Even today still, that exact same site is in the top 5, and im getting 120 to 150 unique visitors a day from it. And this all from 1 and a half cycles!
Nice plagiarism you got going there. Glad you were inspired by cash202's strategy to take some action, but why claim it as your own some 8 months later? Needing some attention?...dick. Give credit where it's due!
Can't post a link yet but the original is on Black Hat World Forum titled "My Seo Blueprint (SENuke, AMR, BMD, Xrumer, Scrapebox)".
I have posted a quick outline of this SEO blueprint in a thread about AMR and people started giving me rep and stuff. It even got reposted by someone. So I decided to polish it up and release to a wider audience in an attempt to snatch some more rep and thanks
What this guide is NOT about:
It is NOT about how to pick a good niche
It is NOT about how to find a good keyword
It is NOT about how to write and spin content
It is NOT about how to make a website convert
It is NOT about how to make money at all
Basically, it is up to you to do a keyword research and make a website that converts. I'd like to say that good ranking DOES NOT guarantee traffic and even if you get some traffic it DOES NOT guarantee you'll make any money off it. The most important lesson I put all in caps.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO DO YOUR KEYWORD RESEARCH
If you fail there, no amount of work on a website and/or traffic will help you to make money. Period. Do you keyword research. Do not go after a tough competition unless you are ready to do a lot of work for several months. Another lesson I've learned is tough competition DOES NOT mean a lot of traffic and tough competition DOES NOT mean big profits. So, pick your battle wisely.
This guide is about is how to IMPROVE YOUR RANKING IN GOOGLE for a specific keyword using some manual labour and aforementioned tools. I come up with it be reverse engineering some successful (in my opinion) affiliate promotions in Google.
I do SEO promotion in cycles. One cycle can take anywhere from one day to one week to execute depending on how much time and effort you are ready to put in. I run one cycle per day (excluding Xrumer and Scrapebox blasts) for some promotions but you need to be very focused and ready to spend long hours in front of a computer (like 12 hours per day at least).
Here are some results I've got.
Case Study 1
Internet marketing related keyword with 28 million competing pages on less than two years old domain with PR 0. I run 7 cycles total, one per day for a week. As a result site moved from position 250+ to number 8 and now remains there even though I don't blast it anymore. First page competition is domains with PR 1-4 and thousands of backlinks. I am the only one with PR 0 on a first page.
Case Study 2
I used the same domain. I decided to promote a five year old product (one of the tools I use). Keyword was "product name review". I wrote a 1500+ words review and run ONE promotional cycle only. As a result I am on a page one spot number 7 for this keyword even though I don't blast anymore. I have the LEAST amount of backlinks among my competition according to Market Samurai. I compete against five year old promotions with thousands of backlinks and exact keywords in the domain name plus PR 1-3.
Case Study 3
I promoted recent self-help product re-launch. I bought the last remaining domain productname.me three weeks before launch (all other TLDs were taken). I've heard .me doesn't rank very well. Well, probable yes. I optimised the website for "product name", "product name review", "product name bonus". I run three cycles for "product name" keyword only after domain got indexed and I DID NOT blast the domain itself with Xrumer and Scrapebox, only feeder sites. As a result I ranked YouTube video number one for "product name bonus" and the site itself is number 9 for "product name bonus" (possible because .me doesn't rank well). For other keywords I rank on a page 2. Again, I was competing with affiliates who were promoting this product for four years already. According to Market Samurai a have whopping ONE backlink now and a video has ZERO.
Here is how one promotional cycle looks like. Feel free to modify it to suit your needs.
1. Pick ONE keyword you'd like to rank for. Some of my sites target a lot of different keywords but I focus one cycle on one keyword only.
2. Write and post a keyword optimised article to the money site (OPTIONAL but highly recommended)
3. Write ANOTHER article, preferably 500+ words to improve your success rate with AMR. I'll call this article the promo article. Hand-spin the article with the help of TheBestSpinner to 70+% unique but PRESERVE THE KEYWORD. I always make sure article is well spun and can be read by a human. No, one click spinning is NOT good enough, sorry. The idea is to write the same quality article you'd put on your money site.
4. Write as many titles for the article as you can (THREE as a minimum). Then spin them with TheBestSpinner and combine together so you have a multi-level spun title.
5. Make a video off the article. I simply use paid version of Animoto and put some free images from Dreamstime together with some key phrases from the article. I then cut Animoto logo with Sony Vegas HD and also add watermark with money site link.
6. Make PowerPoint presentation and PDF off the article. For PDF I use paid version of Zinepal. Give it a go, it's very cool. Make sure each page of your PDF and PowerPoint presentation contains links to the money site.
7. Upload video to YouTube. In description field use your money site URL and some descriptive text preferably containing your keyword. It should look something like this (URL first, then description).
Code:
hxxp://www.moneysite.c0m This is a cool video about keyword. Watch it now to be totally shocked and awed.
8. Upload both PowerPoint and PDF to SlideShare and Scribd. Again, use URL of the money site in description and add some text (DIFFERENT for each file)
9. This is a hard part. MANUALLY submit spun version of your article together with embedded YouTube video to the following Web 2.0 sites: Squidoo, Hubpages, Weebly, Wikia, Wetpaint, Wikispaces, Posterous, Tumblr, Wordpress, Blogspot, Bukisa, Zimbio, Skyrock, MyLivePage and any other Web 2.0 site not supported by SENuke that you know. As a minimum I submit to Squidoo, Hubpages, Weebly, Wikia, Wetpaint, Posterous, Tumblr, Zimbio, Blogspot, and Bukisa. Yes, Hubpages, Wetpaint, Wikispaces, Wordpress, and Blogspot are supported by SENuke but I still submit to them manually because... THE KEY IS TO EMBED VIDEO!
I use TWO links in each article, both pointing to a random page on a money site or to the root of the money site (I rotate URLs using spinner syntax).
If you have time I'd recommend the following additional white hat submissions. Write three more completely unique promo articles and use one on Bukisa, another on InfoBarrel and the last on Quondio. Bukisa accepts well spun content but they kinda picky. InfoBarrel and Quondio are unique content nazis. Remember to EMBED VIDEO.
I usually just submit spun article to Bukisa and ignore InfoBarrel and Quondio. However I have Quondio account and I am going to start using it for my blog (they charge one off $5 fee for the privilege to post there).
10. If you have blog network subscription like UAW or ArticleRanks, post your spun promo article there together with YouTube video. I post to ArticleRanks and set distribution to 250. I've tested AMA, MyArticleNetwork, SEOLinkVine, FreeTrafficSystem and they are all crap because they have NO quality control whatsoever. Articles that get circulated in these networks are poorly spun garbage. The only two article distribution networks that have good content that I tested are ArticleRanks and UAW. I receive trackbacks from ArticleRanks blogs and they are mostly 0 PR blogs with good content (no poorly spun garbage).
Similar to Web 2.0, I use TWO links in each article, both pointing to a random page on a money site or to the root of the money site.
11. Blast promo article with SENuke to all Web 2.0 sites it supports excluding those you've posted to manually.
12. Take YouTube link, SlideShare and Scribd links and all Web 2.0 links where you posted your article manually and with SENuke. You will use this list several times.
13. Use BMD to bookmark this list of sites using bookmarking sites that come with BMD (100+ sites). Enable CAPTCHA solving in BMD for this submission. Ping the bookmarks with BMD after you finish.
14. Make RSS feed of this list and ping it. To save me time I wrote a script that makes RSS feeds from my URLs and pings it. You can use links2rss and then upload a feed to your web hosting account and then ping it with SENuke or BMD. Or, you can use Linklicious paid subscription. I DON'T like Linklicious because they turn all your links into 301 redirects that's why I wrote my own script.
15. Use SENuke to blast RSS feed to RSS directories.
16. Prepare resource box for the promo article. I ONLY use TWO links in the resource box when I blast article with AMR. One is a random URL from the list of Web 2.0 sites I've submitted my article to (including video, PPT, and PDF). Another is direct link to the root of the money site.
I usually write two to three version of the resource box and spin them together using TheBestSpinner. Here is how my resource box usually looks like.
Code:
Discover ways to have great results with stuff nowadays. Grab my [product name review]and discover proper way to do stuff. Simply click here to visit hxxp://www.moneysite.c0m
[product name review] and hxxp://www.moneysite.c0m are links.
17. Blast article with AMR. I successfully registered on 3000+ sites and each submission goes successfully to around 1500+ sites. Out of it I get at least 200-300+ auto-approved articles. Some articles get approved later on. I have received trackbacks from AMR submissions even after 6 weeks (it took them 6 weeks to approve my articles). I didn't pay attention to where I submit and I was kinda surprised to find some of the articles I've blasted with AMR approved by EzineArticles
18. Collect the list of the approved articles. Make RSS feed from it and ping it with SENuke or BMD. Then, blast this feed to RSS directories with SENuke.
19. Use BMD to bookmark all approved articles on 1000+ ****ty Scuttle/Pligg/PHPDug sites. The goal is to have ONE ARTICLE to be bookmarked at least on ONE bookmaking SITE. Don't try to bookmark EACH article on EACH bookmaking site. It'll take weeks
I harvested my own list of 1000+ Scuttle/Pligg/PHPDug sites with Scrapebox. I deleted all the sites that require CAPTCHA to submit a bookmark from the list (account creation is OK, it's one off process).
Make sure you DISABLE CAPTCHA and select an option to skip submission if CAPTCHA is detected. Otherwise you will burn through your DeCaptcher credit pretty quickly and the whole submission will take a lot of time because BMD sometimes reports that CAPTCHA is not required for submission when it really is.
20. Collect all Web 2.0 URLs and article URLs and blast them with Xrumer to 5000 forums. You have a few options here. First is to rotate links to money site, Web 2.0 and articles (I did it on 1+ year old domain). Second is to blast to Web 2.0 and articles (I did it on a brand new domain). Third is to blast to articles only (I did it on a brand new domain too). This is a small 5K blast because it is only one promotional cycle and I do many.
I haven't tested it yet but I have a feeling that two Xrumer blasts will be very effective, one to the money site and second to Web 2.0 and articles. I don't own Xrumer yet so I just order blasts on forums. When I get my own Xrumer I'll run the tests properly.
21. Collect all forum profile URLs and spam the **** out of them with Scrapebox. I used a list of around 60K auto-approve URLs that I collected using various sources.
22. (OPTIONAL) Use Scrapebox to spam the **** out of Web 2.0 and articles.
23. (OPTIONAL) Use Scrapebox to spam the **** out of money site, if you dare.
I did both 22 and 23 on 1+ year old domain and 22 only on brand new domain. I didn't dare to spam the **** out of brand new domain directly
I NEVER LOST ANY RANKING OR GET SITE DEINDEXED WITH THIS METHOD. EVER.
If it sounds like a lot of work, it is. But you will get a good diversified link network from the day one. Search around the forum and you'll see people who take shortcuts are whining their sites disappeared from index after the blast or get deindexed or whatever. This method is all about building a good link network and tools like SENuke, AMR and BMD are just used to save time and manual labour.
SOME RANDOM TIPS
I use one set of SENuke accounts per niche.
Open as many accounts as you can on 100+ main BMD sites. The more the better. You submissions will be faster and your accounts stay alive longer.
Pinging a lot of links with BMD takes time. I usually ping everything in one go and let it run overnight while I sleep.
Don't worry about your Xrumer/Scrapebox links getting indexed. Let Google find it. It works kinda like drip feed this way. They will and DO appear as backlinks in Market Samurai over time.
Wow. That's all, folks. This is the longest freaking post I've ever written. Now it's time to have some beer and get back to Assassin Creed. One more assassination in Jerusalem left.

It's guys like you two that really make it all worth while trying to help others...thanks "dicks"
By the way, why dont you two share some great seo advice for everyone? Are you guys even making a living online - are you even making anything?
probably not - cause you spend your time on stupid **** like flaming other people's truly helpful threads....

Anyways thanks for answering my questions man, I'm doing this method with a few mods to see if it'll work for me!
Thanks bud...but clearly many don't appreciate my efforts as much as you...
If you get some results, will be great to hear about them...come back and let us know about the mods and how they worked for you...

Well, if you ARE cash then I would apologize. Otherwise you totally ripped his thread with a little rewording right down to "Now it’s time to have some beer and get back to Assassin Creed. One more assassination in Jerusalem left. "
Am I making $$$ online most certainly. Not to my personal goal of at least $5000+ a month yet but well on the way after a year and some change efforts.
If you notice my post count I don't really hang out on this forum much at all. Way too much BS being slung around. Takes you hours to find even a small nugget
You are not from Durban are you? Trying to find some Warriors to connect with!
Sorry bud, from the north west, about 2hr drive from JHB...but it might be worth starting a thread here, ive spoken to other guys on here from your area...

When you add more content to your site, do you add it to the same page you are backlinking? So, you keep adding more content to the same page, is that it; or do you add more pages to the site?
Also, have you ever noticed a difference between ranking a 1 page site, and ranking 1 page of a larger site?
I normally add content to the same page im currently running a cycle for. When i start running another cycle for a different page and keyword i would start adding new content to that page.
It's generally easier to rank 1 page of a larger site...especially if you been adding new content at least 3 to 4 times a week. At first it takes some time to get rolling, but once Google is used to the site being updated often, it's pretty quick to get a new page ranked, as apposed to ranking a brand new site with one page.
Also remember to update your sitemap and submit to Google webmaster tools each time you add new content..

I'm sure its possible to out source some of this on fiverr or dont you think?
Yes definitely...check out my outsourcing tips on page 2 of this thread. But if you constantly need to be running these cycles then in the end it's going to cost you much more per cycle than simply hiring a full time VA for $400 a month. But I think fiverr is a good option if you run the odd cycle here and there.

Ha ha...no need for an ebook buddy, you should have all the info you need right here in this thread.
So currently the site is involved in the Google dance...floating around between positions 7 and 13...The broad keyword is between positions 17 and 22
I don't wanna start another SEO cycle on it right now becuase I wana give some time for the dust to settle...(Plus all my VA's are busy on other projects ;-) ). So i think a few more days to see where it lies, but to be honest i think I am going to need at least another cycle to move it up to a comfortable page 1 ranking.
What i've done:
I added some new content to the target page...nothing major, some pics and about 3 paragraphs of content. And then I ran some additional social bookmarking campaigns on my AMR links...The idea is just to have the site "busy" with links and new updates while in the Google dance...
Hi Nick, fantastic thread you have here, many thanks for the information, it has to be the best thing I've red on any SEO forum. Might I ask how much you would charge me to run one cycle if I was to supply the first article? (I did try to pm you but I am new here).
Might I ask how much you would charge me to run one cycle if I was to supply the first article?
Hey bud, im sorry but at the moment im not running any cycles for anyone. I have had a lot of PM's asking me to do this, so i might consider setting up a team and start offering this as a service at a later stage.

Ok guys, so I've left the site for a few more days to see what it does while in the Google dance...at the moment it is hovering between position 7 and 9 for it's main target keyword and between positions 17 and 21 for a secondary. broad keyword.
Results:
I am receiving about 50 unique visitors a day from it's current ranking, and I have no doubt that when I hit the top 3 i will receive well over 100 uniques a day. Not bad going for a site that has so far only cost me about 4 days work
I think I underestimated the power of my top 10 competitors one this one, (as they are mainly authority-type sites). I really thought I would have a comfortable top 5 ranking after one cycle. But now, after watching the site closely for about a week, I have decided to go ahead and run another SEO cycle on it - targeting once again only my main target keyword. I hope to lock in a decent top 5 ranking at least with this cycle.
I love this. you are complete guide the warriors. you are the real Warrior

That's quite a ranking strategy. Way too complicated for me!!!! There is definitely an easier way. Too many people make it so complicated!! I'm able to rank competitve keyword phrases with 50 - 60 backlinks and in about 3 months. Blog network backlinks are the best I've used.
Great advice and special thanks for sharing something about Video posting and sharing.
It is sure that anyone cannot deny that Web 2.0 sites are very important in a SEO Strategy in order to get top ranks on Google

Good for you bud, as i said before if you guys can do it with less effort then why not.
I have developed this strategy as it give me results quick, and they last...

Definitely, web2.0 is a great way to help diversify your links, as well as provide content so that the search engines have a better idea of what your site is about...
I've done quite a bit of SEO over the years and though I've tried many of the techniques you have mentioned, I don't think I have done them in the specific order and "cycle" in which you say you have been doing it.
So I decided to give it a shot. I have an authority site in a B2B niche for which I am trying to rank for 2 main keywords. These keywords are fiercely competitive (similar to let's say the likes of "make money online"). My main keyword had been stuck at #9ish for the past few months, and the secondary keyword around #38ish. I achieved these positions over a couple of years mainly by slow, automated link building (with a few 'adrenaline injections' every so often), and lately I had not done much and noticed my rankings were kind of slipping and competitors were slowly inching above me. I also jumped into this market for a 3rd highly competitive KW about a month ago and had managed to push into the 40's as well, mainly due to the authority and age of the site itself with some small linkbuilding.
So I went ahead and ran one of your 'cycles' for fun and here's what I got:
Keyword 1 (Main Keyword):
Before: Position #9 on Google
After: #6 a couple of days ago, #5 as of today
Keyword 2 (Secondary Keyword):
Before: #38ish
Now: #19-20ish
Keyword 3 (New Keyword):
Before: #40's
Now: #20's with sightings in the teens here and there.
The 'cycle' is not even fully complete yet, as I'm always juggling a million things and am pretty lazy at the same time (lol), so I still have to completely the final few steps (Bookmarking AMR articles, rss'ing them, and some other stuff, but the meat of the cycle was done).
I'll probably be running another cycle on these keywords and I'm sure a 2nd cycle would land me top 3, if not #1, for my main KW, with significant jumps in other KW's as well. Once I get the hang of the process myself I will figure out an efficient and safe manner to outsource it like you have.
Again thanks for the share buddy and PM me if I can be of any assistance.

Now: #19-20ish
Keyword 3 (New Keyword):
Before: #40's
Now: #20's with sightings in the teens here and there.
The 'cycle' is not even fully complete yet, as I'm always juggling a million things and am pretty lazy at the same time (lol), so I still have to completely the final few steps (Bookmarking AMR articles, rss'ing them, and some other stuff, but the meat of the cycle was done).
I'll probably be running another cycle on these keywords and I'm sure a 2nd cycle would land me top 3, if not #1, for my main KW, with significant jumps in other KW's as well. Once I get the hang of the process myself I will figure out an efficient and safe manner to outsource it like you have.
Again thanks for the share buddy and PM me if I can be of any assistance.
This is fantastic! You are the first person to pop back to the thread and post your results...I hope you not the first to have actually taken action! Good on ya!
The results you are seeing are pretty typical for these cycles...hopefully you see some more movement after you complete the cycle. But another 1 or 2 cycles and you should be exactly where you want to be!
For very competitive keywords like what you are targeting, there's just three things I would do slightly differently:
1. Make sure you add new content to the page before running the cycle
2. When running the cycle, use a promo article that is much longer than the traditional 400 or 500 word article. I just ran a cycle for a very competitive keyword using a 980 word article, spun about 76% unique, and seeing great results.
3. Use a different article for the AMR blast...
But it's nice to read about your results, makes all the time and effort i put into this thread well worth it...Thanks for posting
Nick just read the whole thread and have started to use your case study on the site. I don't have AMR but is it possible for you to share the list of the Auto approve directories ?
Thanks.
Hey bud, literally all i did was search google for it. A whole bunch of lists come up and just import them all in AMR...the software will automatically add the new directories that it is able to post to...all the others will simply be discarded.

Great thread,just a few questions.I outsource some stuff on fiverr right now and I am a memberof one of the mentioned blog networks. Backling your backlinks is very important and I have missed this point on my sites. My question is what do you think about services like backlink booster or backlink indexer instead of manually bookmarking your properties. Are these ones good to use?

Hey Nick,
Thanks for the reply. I wanted to know if you could share the list of directories that auto approve your article. AMR has a big list and a lot of directories don't work.

I only ask because I do not have scrapebox and senukex
Really great thread and keep it up

I personally don't use them, but that does not mean that they do not work. The best way to find out is to test it yourself!

Thanks for the thread Nick. I have always concentrated more on getting the backlinks indexed rather than just building them but I am following a couple of other things like submitting articles in article directories, linking them to each other and get them bookmarked manually after approval. I have not used automation for this process but still helps a lot in ranking my keywords well in search engines.
You're a man with a plan. Thanks for sticking in even though some idiots feel like they need to degrade your efforts. Too often contributors give up because of a few bozos, who spend their off time from their boring real job, surfing the WF and being belligerent.
Out of curiosity, since you're obviously have a successful, replicable plan in place, what types of websites do you construct to take advantage of all this SEO juice (adsense, review, offline, etc)?
Thanks again for your outstanding post. I agree with others. It could easily be a WSO (and worth more than most).

Ok.
They're not "bozos". They're pointing something out on this thread that I had previously done in a private message to the OP, namely that this strategy is virtually identical to that of another guy who posted the same strategy on another forum but eight months earlier. The structure is the same, the terminology is identical in some places and way too many other instances that the OP could honestly claim this to be his own original plan.
I don't want to get into an argument about whether they're not 100% identical or not as I don't need a weather man to tell me it's raining
That being said, Nick obviously knows what he's talking about and if the fact that many people in this thread were unaware of this strategy on another forum is argument enough that Nick is providing value for WF members by creating this thread here in the first place.
In an attempt to bring this thread back on track can I ask Nick if you recommend other forms of backlinking other than this strategy ?
If I adhere only to creating web 2.0's that point back to my money site then I will only end up with around 20-30 sites linking back to my site.
I'm concerned that even low to medium competition keywords can have a few hundred or thousand backlinks pointing back to the money site.

Thanks, and as we all know SEO is not an exact science...so im sure there are plenty of other link building strategies that work great too...and as i said, if you guys get the same results with less effort, then why not, right?
Good on ya for taking action!

No probs bud, glad you find it useful.
As for the types of sites i personally build - I normally do adsense sites or affiliate (list building) sites. Sometimes I start with adsense, then when the site is up and running nicely I would incorporate list building and promote affiliate products via the list...

Should I supplement this strategy with other forms of backlinking ?
Yeah I don't see any reason at all why you can not add other types of links to your strategy as well - after all, the more diverse your links are the better. As mentioned earlier by another member, a great idea would be to use Press Release links too...
This strategy is simply what I personally use to rank my own sites. You guys can all modify it as you please to find what works for you. In the end of the day though, you are going to need to test different strategies over time till you find something that suites you better...
The only thing I want to say about this is, if you are building other types of links to your money site as well, always make sure it's done in great quality content. Never leave your links in content that is poorly spun and blatantly "spammy"
Where we currently stand Ok guys so on Monday i said I want to complete another cycle for the site by the end of tuesday...unfortunately that did not happen as my VA's had system problems and got very little work done.
I know it seems my VA's are extremely unreliable but overall they really not bad at all - it just so happens that the two hiccups I had this month with them were both on this case study site!
So all in all not a very successful week at all regarding this site. Not much progress has been made.
The plan Hopefully my VA's will have their systems sorted by tomorrow or so...then the two VA's I had on this cycle will be put on to other projects I have running to get those back on track.
I will try to use 1 VA sometime when I get a gap to complete this cycle - im hoping to complete this 2nd cycle for this site by the end of the week.
Results so far Not much has changed here guys. The site is floating around position7 and 8 for the main keyword and around position 17 and 20 for a much broader secondary keyword.
For monday and Tuesday the site was pretty much at position 7 the entire time and I saw quite a nice increase in traffic - Monday got 119 uniques and Tues got 107 Uniques. I think this is due it's consistency in being the one position for such a long time and not hopping around to page 2 for half the day!
For today, I noticed the site has been at position 8 pretty much the whole day, and so far for the day I got 61 Uniques - coincidence? I don't know...
When I started this case study site, I didn't really put too much thought into it. I thought if i get it to page 1 I'd be happy and leave it at that...it was built purely for the sake of the case study.
But judging from the traffic for the last few days, I'm starting to think i should pull this site off the "side line" and dedicate some resources to get it to the top 3. I originally thought the top 3 would bring in about 100 / 120 unique visitors, but im getting that at position 7! So at position 2 or 3 I might see between 300 and 500 uniques a day - which I think is very good for a small, one-page niche site!
I will post an update again soon, probably next week after the 2nd cycle has been completed and I see some movement in the SERPS
So at position 2 or 3 I might see between 300 and 500 uniques a day - which I think is very good for a small, one-page niche site!
Im wondering, with such a "thin" site, do expect that it will stay on page 1 for long. Or since you said you might put some extra effort into it. Are you planning on building the site out with lots more content, and if you are, how many pages do you add before your confident that its going to hold its ranking.
Nick, I'm glad to see you still have this going and haven't abandoned it like some folks do who start case-studies like this.
I have a question about why you open separate web2.0 accounts for each site you so a cycle on. Do you find that it helps them to rank better this way, or do you just do it so that you aren't putting all of your eggs in one basket, so to speak?
I'd like to add that your system will work best
provided your site is perfectly seo optimised,
meaning titles, internal linking, lsi, outlinks to
authority sites, keyword density, etc.
I would also take more care with Facebook,
Twitter, Linkedin and Google+1.
All the best,
DJorge
Yes, I thought this goes without saying...but you make a good point. There's absolutely NO USE putting in all this effort to run these cycles if your page itself is not well optimized for the keyword.
As for the social networking, normally all i do is use addthis.com to put in a Facebook, Twitter and Google+1 button in my sidebar at the top. Normally people start clicking these on their own once I start getting traffic. If you targeting a difficult keyword though, may be worth purchasing FB likes and Google+1's from fiverr...but i never do this

Normally, I start my sites with at least 8 pages of content. Then as time goes by i'll target additional keywords on more pages.
As for the case study site...it should stay on the first page. The only thing thats bothering me a little is that most of my competitors are authority-type sites with hundreds of pages of content. So this might cause problems later on...
It might be worth adding additional content to the site on other pages, but this is going to be a little difficult to do while keeping everything relevant as the site is an EMD...ill pretty much have to expand on my current keyword - maybe target the LSI keywords on additional pages. Will still ponder on this one! But you make a good point - thanks!

I start new site's cycles on new accounts for two reasons:
1. As you say, I don't want to put all my "eggs in one basket". If all my site's links were under a single account, and they decide to ban my account - then ALL my links will be lost with it. And here and there accounts DO get banned!
2. Some of the sites (Like weebly) require you to upgrade to a pro account account after a certain amount of posts. To avoid having to keep upgrading to paid accounts I simply open another account and post again.
I have followed your thread and liked what you documented here. I have one question. How do you get a backlink from document sites (like scribd) since the embedded links in the document do not get counted?
Regarding the video do you recommend creating a new YouTube account for each site/niche we're trying to target ?
Yes...YouTube accounts are created along with all the other accounts each time a new site is worked on

The idea is to get diverse links, from different sources with different PR's BUT to have the links in relevant content. So even if the links are nofollow...they still work in your favour for SEO...they just do not pass on PR link juice to your site..but they are still seen by Google
Hey, thanks for getting back to me. I guess that it's really just being naive to think that your account will never get banned. I can see now that using proxies and multiple accts. just goes hand in hand.

Thanks to Nick's strategies for the SEO cycle, my site has finally made it back to the first page of Google for two competitive keywords after doing the Google Dance for over a month. My site was not ranked on the first page since December 2 and not it's back! The good part about the cycle is that I only did about %75 of the steps. Hopefully my site keeps going up.
This is fantastic news! And proof that real hard work in SEO pays off! Thanks for sharing your results...let us know what happens in the future after running multiple (full) cycles on your pages - would love to read more good news!
Great post. It seems that if you look for it, everything you need to know about all aspects of internet marketing is somewhere in this forum, however, I wonder how many people will actually take all these steps or will continually look for some non-existent fast way and pay hundred or thousands of dollars for something that doesn't work???

Thanks. And unfortunately you are correct, many people will simply move on and look for their "magic button"!

Really great thread by the way! Great share :-)
I would run one cycle (with good quality content) to get them moved into the top 3
Regarding Accounts, I only ever create new accounts when I start working on a new site. Some sites have 10+ SEO cycles done on them already, and the same set of accounts was used! I always use proxies, sometimes private, paid proxies and other times just free scraped proxies from scrapebox.
When you run a cycle for a 2nd kw on same site, do you post to the same web 2.0 properties? If you do do you just make a new post with the new video and link to the KW?

Yes, all subsequent keywords from the same site are run on the same accounts. I don't just add a post, the idea is to create a new URL with new content which has your links in it. So a new page, lens, blog etc... will be created for the new cycle.
Also something else worth mentioning here...there are some sites that require you to upgrade to paid membership before additional pages can be created. On these I simply create new accounts under new proxies and post again...

I am currently trying this strategy on my 3 newest sites, I have a question. You mention that you create a new url so would it be
keyword1.example.com, keyword2.example.com
also how does this work with the senuke 2.0s?
Thank you so much for this amazing strategy, I will report back on my rankings once they are finished!
Hard and continious SEO work will surely payoff in the end if you chosen good keyword. It just needs a lot of work. My advice is that you should stricly follow this SEO blueprint. And most important, don`t give up!

Thanks bud...and you are correct. Hard, and CONSISTENT work in SEO WILL pay off...how quickly it will pay off all depends on the keywords you have chosen to rank for.

Where to you place your link in Docstoc and Scribd? ALso are dofollow links?
Thanks
I simply place them within the PDF or SlideShow...the links become part of the content
As far as I know you are correct, they are nofollow links. But that only means they dont pass on the PR link juice...Google still sees the links, and the content the links are placed in.
You must remember, with our strategy here the idea is to get a diverse set of links...the more diverse it is the more natural it looks. And it would not look very natural if ALL your links are dofollow from high PR sites...

Yes that's exactly right...each time you submit new content to these sites it will be done on a new subdomain or page as you have mentioned:
keyword1.eample.com then keyword2.example.com
or
example.com/keyword1 then example.com/keyword2
Just depends on the site.
With SenukeX I create new accounts each time I submit content, because the process is easy enough. But I think there is actually an option in Senukex where you can select to have it post to the same accounts - i never use it though...
Will be great if you come back and post your results, will be a very interesting read for us all...

P.S- Thanks for all the info in your thread. I have learned a lot just from your 1 thread
1. SenukeX
2. a blog network subsrciption
3. AMR
BUT with these tools you still have the major problem of manually creating accounts to submit manual content to with your video embeded. So you have 3 options in this regard:
1. Hire someone to do it (recommended)
2. Do it yourself - very time consuming and tedious
3. Buy uBot studio and create a bot to do it - VERY time consuming in the beginning - and requires constant effort to keep the bot working as sites change etc...

I dedicated an entire post to outsourcing tips on page 2 of this thread...check it out
I am glad I found this thread. I have followed two other methods of seo that have not worked for me. Thanks for saying "not to auto spin articles". I am now convinced that this is one of my problems. All that time and effort for nothing. Although I have to say, yahoo search does not seem as critical. My first site was slapped by the big G but is still #3 with yahoo. Go figure.
I already started a cycle on a new domain. Time and money will not allow me to complete cycles very quickly. I am hoping to complete the first one with in two weeks. For articles, I will not use TBS this time. I just ordered all original ones and will use them. I can keep updating here as time goes by.
@NickWatson: Do you offer this as a complete service? If so, I would like to place an order for a cycle
Sorry bud, I do not offer this as a service. But I have had TONS of PM's asking me to do this, so I might set up a team at later stage and let them run cycles for warriors...so keep an eye out

Great, let us know how it works out for you. Updates on your progress will be great...
As for the content, I have actually tested it thoroughly, and when using duplicate or poorly spun content the results were always very poor...even with my SEO cycles. The more unique, relevant and more of it (longer articles etc...) the better the results.
And when doing the manual submissions, don't be shy to make the content look good...add relevant pics to some of the paragraphs...embed your video etc etc...when you done and look at the page, it must really look good.
I have no doubt whatsoever that Google definitely has grammar built into it's algorithm..good quality, readable content always see's good results
" Add two links in the article. Normally my one link goes to the page with the target keyword (The keyword is used as anchor text). My other link is normally linked to my home page (where my site's main keyword is used as anchor text). Make sure that each time you spin the article the links are left intact. "
Could you please explain a bit more about it. I am getting confused here. I have to give links to the page i am targeting or home page? what if i am targeting the keyword from my home page?
You are reading WAAAY too much into this buddy! Just add links to your site in your articles! I was simply stating the links i personally use in my articles! Sometimes I do it it differently depending on the site...
If your main keyword is the home page, then build two links to your home page...1 using the main target keyword as anchor text and the other using a LSI keyword. Or just use one link in each article...does not really matter!!
So I uploaded some PDFs with working links in the files. Unfortunately, in the Scribd and DocStoc platform, the links in the PDF files are not clickable!
Therefore, is it still worth even posting these?
THANK YOU for bringing this to my attention! I have been having my VA's chug along happily submitting content to Docstoc for a long time now - and MOST of my links are not clickable, just as you said!
I checked through multiple results from past submissions and about 90% of the PDF's we submitted are non-clickable. Looks like this took affect in april 2010 already!
I contacted them to find out why only some are clickable, and they said they do it on a case-by-case basis. If you want your links clickable now, you have to contact their support with your username and document name and they will consider making the links live.
I've even checked the source of the pages the PDF's appear on...and they do not have a link ANYWHERE to your site. When someone downloads your document, the links are clickable to them on their computer...so this is the ONLY advantage i see of still submitting content to docstoc - you might get a little traffic from downloads of your files. But don't expect much!
So as it stands, I dont see ANY SEO benefit of submitting content to docstoc...and they will be removed from future cycles.
As for Scribd, all my links are working just fine. Can't see why yours are not? I know it sounds stupid, but you might want to double check that the links have actually been hyperlinked in your orginal PDF??
hi nick, im a full time follower of this thread, however i wants to know how to rank a website which doesnt have articles in it, i mean something like games download or music downloads? whats the seo method for that kind of websites
Great thread, looks like you're welcome lots of members navigate successfully down the road to profitable niche sites.
Thanks for sharing!
Phil
Thanks Phil, had a read through your blog...you got a nice case study going there as well..

Firstly, i think you should REALLY, REALLY consider putting up some optimized content...for download pages you could provide information on what the person is downloading...
It's going to be very difficult to rank a site without decent content...especially in the games / music download niche.
Otherwise, the only other thing you can really do is make sure you optimize all your meta tags with your keyword, as well as your url...then simply keep building backlinks to your page using your keyword as anchor text...but you going to need a lot of links, and a lot of time...(and a big budget!)
Nick, I have never used senukex before. When you do a social bookmark campaign with all the AMR links, do you have do them one at a time, or is there a way to import them and run them all in auto?
Bill
Hi Bill. You can put all the links in the software, then select for it to social bookmark randomly to X amount of URL's. If i have the man power, i get my guys to run a campaign on 5 URLs at a time, but set the software to bookmark any 2 each time at a social bookmarking site.
Another tip when using SenukeX...get yourself some private proxies. Any other way will see poor to average success rates at best. I use SquidProxies for this...(If you use squidproxies - you need to email their support and tell them you want proxies that work with captcha - because some of theres dont)

Just search google, you will find plenty lists to import into your AMR - te software will sort them automatically
Are you still doing your case study, or are you letting the site dance for now? I looked, but I may have missed any updates about how your site is ranking. The last one I remember reading was after the first cycle and the site was around 7-8 on the first page.
Have you done any more after this? Have your rankings changed now that you have stopped?
Thanks for an excellent post.
Now, if I could just get you to do this for me ... life would be perfect
LifeIsGood ~ It's About To Get Even Better!
Thanks..As i mentioned before, i have had tons of people ask me to do this for them...so i am in the process of training a new team of VA's...soon to be running cycles for warriors...so keep an eye out...life will be getting "perfect" soon!

CASE STUDY UPDATE
Sorry guys, I should have updated you guys long ago on the status of this case study.
Previously I was running the second cycle...this cycle was never quite completed as I got my VA's onto other projects and kinda forgot about the case study
What's been done 1. A total of one and a half SEO cycle's has been completed for this site.
The Results 1. Average Google position of between 5 and 6 - on the first page 2. Currently traffic is between 65 and 120 unique visitors a day 3. Adsense earnings: CTR of 0.77% and CPC of $1.07
The Future and it's potential I could probably do a few things to increase traffic and earnings - but to be honest I am very busy working on other, more lucrative projects and will probably just leave this site as it is.
The first thing I would do is look at its horrendous CTR, would try increase that by split testing various themes and ad layouts.
The second thing that can be done is increase it's traffic by improving it's ranking. As a lot of it's competition is authority-type sites, I would do this by adding new content and then running another cycle.
But as I said, I think I am just going to leave this site now to chug along...will probably try a few different ad layouts to get a higher CTR rate.

I randomly came across this thread, packed full of very valuable information.
The guy that keeps complaining about some other program that is very close - we are all learning here, so thanks for starting the thread, so that more people can improve their skills.
I used to use Matt LeClair's 5000 links (5000 spun articles over 5000 blogs, with link signatures) and a guaranteed page 1 ranking. I bought a TON of his stuff, and am still ranking for those very competitive terms. His products are no longer working (maybe he got kicked off the blog subscription???) Have been looking a long time for something that will be as effective, purchased many WSOs for link building, etc, but nothing has been effective.
This thread has given me hope - although it's not as easy as clicking on a PayPal button and have someone do it. But all success requires work.
As for people who are looking for outsourcers, I have been using easyoutsource.com. I post a job, tons of people will submit their services. I will ask them to complete a quick task to prove they can follow through, the 1-3 people that actually follow through, I will hire.
Thanks, it's posts like this that make all the effort I put into this thread well worth it. I'm glad to know it's helping at least a few people.
And thanks for the outsourcing tips...I have not used them myself, but looks like it can be a decent source for workers.

Alexa rank of my site: 6,481,580
Key word rank: not in the top 3 hundred. Domain name is not EMD for keyword either.
Let's see what happens
Total spent: $30 + my time
PS: once i complete the blog blueprinting, i will then ping all links and move onto social bookmarking
NICE! Way to go on taking action! It's going to be great to see what kind of results you get from this. Just remember to follow through with your cycle - social bookmarking, rss feeds, pings and scrapebox.
I look forward to seeing an update on your results...thanks for posting
What i have noticed about SEONuke is that it is not that great for building the core link wheel, but it is good for supporting it.
When you build a SEONuke linkwheel and use #linkurl# to create the link wheel, if one site is rejected the link wheel is broken. It is better to create a manual web2.0 linkwheel and then upload those urls and use the #link_randomURL# tag to ensure the integrity of the wheel regardless if any of the properties get rejected.
I have found some niche keyword, and not more competitor. I buy the new domain with this keyword and create 1 unique article and publish it.
And I started Ping and create PDF files, and upload to Scribd, Docstoc... After that, my site have been index and run on top Google. I have #2 on page 1. And I got 200 unique visit/per day after 2 day buy domain & build site.
I create a second article and post it, and my site still good ranking on Google. I didn't build any other backlink in "Cycles". Just add more article and Google indexed it.
I got 200 visit daily in 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, my main keyword run to #56 and all related also run to page 5,6 . Till now, my keyword is on page 7,8. I also add more content for it but nothing happen.
So, can you have any ideas to get back my site or what I do wrong with it ?

Hi. Well it sounds like your site is not even a month old yet. And what you are experiencing is probably the Google dance. Another thing that may cause problems is if you are building links from only one or two sources...you need diverse links to see sustainable results
The best way out of it in my opinion is to continue building links. Add fresh content to your site, then run an ENTIRE cycle...make sure you use GOOD quality content for your site and for your cycle.
How often do you change your proxy when doing the cycle? Do you change proxy every 1 cycle?
What if the video is only 30secs long instead of a 1min-2min one as you stated? Will it still be effective?
Stan
I normally use a new private proxy for each cycle. But have a few proxies in use, and simply cycle trough them. meaning when I get to the end of the list i start at the top again and re-use the proxies for other cycles.
The amount of proxies in my list depends on how many cycles im running and how often. I want a fairly long time to go by before I use a proxy again for a new cycle.
As for the video, I recommend using at least a 1min video...you can not get much info into a 30sec video...

Your thoughts?
I agree...I never use SenukeX on its own for building links. But i also dont use it to build link wheels. I rely heavily on manual submissions of content, and use SenukeX to support and strengthen those links

Hi Nick. I see that you advise on spinning the article. I lot of people on the forum believe that spinning is a waste of time and article syndication is better. Can you tell my why you advocate spinning and why you think this is the best route?
Hi Nick. I see that you advise on spinning the article. I lot of people on the forum believe that spinning is a waste of time and article syndication is better. Can you tell my why you advocate spinning and why you think this is the best route?
What's your definition of "article syndication"?
The reason I advise spinning the articles is to make them unique. This way, each time you submit the article to a web2.0 property or article directory, it will be unique (somewhat at least) to all the other links you are building.
The only way to do better than this, is to actually have a new article written from scratch for EACH web2.0 property you want to submit content to. And to be honest, if you deep spin your article by spinning sentences as well as words, the cost of having ALL new articles written does not outweigh the benefit.
I have also done thorough testing on simply using the exact same content when building links. But it is very clear that better results are seen much faster when unique / spun content is being used.
Also note, when i say "spin" the content - i do NOT mean copy it into The Best Spinner and click the auto spin button! This always ends with poor quality content - which is no good!
When i say spin, i mean MANUALLY spin the content (with the help of TBS) so that each spin is 100% readable and consists of good grammar.
Hi Nick, thanks for sharing your strategy plan!
I want to ask you about SeNukeX usage. Do you use your money site URL when using SeNukeX? I read a lot that it'll risk your moneysite into a sandbox. Need your opinion here since I'm planning to use Senuke for my moneysite.
I think one thing not stressed enough in the this post and similar posts about the whole process is that if the ROI (return on investment) is not there this is all a moot point.
People often get so obsessed with ranking they forget that the bottom line is you have to make more money than you spend. I see it all the time where someone goes crazy on getting ranked only to make a buck a day.
I don't disagree with OP on methodology but the big point left out is that you should always do everything you can to make sure that the end result is worth the time, money, and effort.
You can't have all winners but you need enough to cover the cost of the losers . So you need to spend some serious effort and time on picking the right horse to ride.

This is so true, and to be honest a point I thought goes without saying. But you make a VERY Good point, no point hiring a VA, buying private proxies and a whole army of SEO tools and Blog Network subscriptions if you only making $10 a month.
For each keyword you target, you must make sure that it's going to be worth your effort. And frankly this is pretty easy...you can get a very rough idea of the amount of traffic you can expect from number 1 rankings...and then work on all the standard CTR and conversion rates - all of which are available on this forum...and you can calculate an exact amount you think your page will make...this will allow you to buget more accurately when setting it up and getting it ranked.
Another point worth mentioning, when calculating what a page is going to be worth to you, work on the most conservative figures available...it's always nice to see when you were expecting $100 a week from a particular page but it's bringing in $250...

This is true. People must also pay attention to factors on their sites that help to convert like Sales Copy, demand etc...

Yes, I find that this strategy works for pushing websites up the search engines.
Most people try to push all the keywords at once and it is really frustrating if you put in a lot of work and do not see results instantly.
For me I work with three keywords at a time. I also try to first concentrate on the main three links of my website that I consider important such as (home page, get-edu-backlinks.html,link-wheel-service.html)
I then work on those and make sure the anchor text distribution is perfect for my target keyword. So my main keyword is buy backlinks and this points to my home page. The other two would still point to my home page and to their exact pages.
This makes your link building look natural instead of having 100% of all links to your main page read as Buy backlinks.
In all this, outsourcing will help you to avoid burning out and giving up.
Just wondering how many links you normally get from a single cycle, will help me judge how many cycles I need for beating my competition.
And one more question, when you say thorough Social Bookmarking campaign could you just gve some detail, is this 100 bookmarks for example.
Thanks
For the amount of links per cycle, I could not give you an exact figure. I get about 50 backlinks in total for the manual web2.0's, SenukeX campaign, YouTube video and PDF's + SlideShow.
But then for the Blog Networks and the AMR campaign I could not give you an exact figure. The AMR campaign normally also gives between 30 and 50 backlinks that are auto approved, but the article is successfully submitted to between 1300 and 2000 directories...some of these will approve the article later, some of them won't.
Same with the blog networks..some of these networks distribute the article to thousands of blogs...some of them drip feed the article to blogs over time....
So im sorry, but there's just no way to give you an exact figure on this one!
As for the "thorough social bookmarking" campaign. This is where multiple accounts are created on the social bookmarking sites, and only TWO URLS are bookmarked to one account. So for every TWO URLS, a new set of accounts is used.
The campaigns are run on all the available sites in SenukeX. What happens here is each URL ends up receiving at least 1 link from EVERY social bookmarking site...but mostly on different accounts - so that if any one account is banned, only 2 bookmarks are lost.
For the "quick random" social bookmarking on the AMR links, all the URLS are entered into SenukeX on only a handful accounts. Then the campaign is run to randomly bookmark two of the AMR links. What happens here, is that the links are basically spread over all the bookmarking sites...so each URL only gets 1 or 2 social bookmarks from only 1 or 2 social bookmarking sites.

Glad you enjoyed the post and thanks for the tips, always interesting to read someone else's viewpoint on SEO strategy...
Another point to make is none of this matters at all if you don't get or don't plan to get your traffic from search engines.
And since search engines can (and do) change all the time, even if you use this as a means to get traffic, you should have several other methods too so that you don't have everything on this one thing.
I would like to point this strategy involve an EMD which is doing almost 70% from the SEO plan.
The EMD plan is still a very easy way to rank on first page with very few links, doesn't matter which are the BIG websites on the first page, iimportant is the first 5 spots to not be also EMDs

Yeah well I would have thought this goes without saying...What i have laid out is simply my link-building strategy...you still need to make sure your pages are well optimized for the keyword, add new content regularly...only THEN use my strategy to help you move up the SERPS...to get search engine traffic.
I do also agree on diversification, and it's always a good idea to have multiple methods lined up...or at least 2 or 3 different income streams relying on different traffic techniques...but saying that though, 90% of my traffic is from SEO...

I don't know if the Nick strategy state for non EMD websites
Many of my websites are general domain names, only with the actual pages named after the keywords im targeting...and i see similar results with them too...
As long as you are targeting the right keywords, and do on page SEO well too, the cycles should AT LEAST help you see some movement up the serps...for more difficult keywords, you will need multiple cycles ofcourse..

Yes, thats exactly what i do. I only add about 50 URLS to each RSS feed...so I might end up with 4 or 5 RSS feeds for each cycle...then these are submitted with SenukeX and Pinged

Yes, this is correct. In fact you need to be very vigilant when creating accounts and submitting your content. Always use CCLEANER to remove cookies and temporary internet files before creating adn submitting content. Also use proxies when creating accounts and submitting content...I aim not to use the same proxy more than once a week...
On each cycle some of the web2.0's will delete your accounts, and others won't. Also, some (Like Bukisa) will not even accept your content - they do thorough duplicate content checks. But its still worth submitting to them, because when they are accepted its worth while
The only thing though, you need to contact their support and ask them for proxies that work with Captcha. Because many proxies in their network are banned by captcha - so you will probably end up with a few of these in the batch you buy.
Well, this isn't anything new, there techniques have been around for a long time. Hasn't Google learnt how to detect then and penalize? Doesn't it seem unnatural for Google that so many back links show up at the same time?
Well, this isn't anything new, there techniques have been around for a long time. Hasn't Google learnt how to detect then and penalize? Doesn't it seem unnatural for Google that so many back links show up at the same time?
I never said its new. I simply said this is what i use to rank my own websites, and laid it out for everyone to use (or not)
I have never had ANY of my sites penalized using this strategy. If i run a cycle on a site, i ALWAYS see at least some improvement in ranking...and it lasts. Once my pages settle on page 1, very few of them move down again.
Would you mind elaborating on YOUR SEO strategy? I'm curious to hear what approach you take.
2. Quick Social Bookmarking campaign. Again use SenukeX or Book Marking Demon and bookmark the AMR links. This does not have to be thorough. The idea is simply to bookmark each AMR URL on at least three social bookmarking sites.
How many VA's do you have working on 1 cycle per week? Could you please tell me how long it takes your VA to create a Web 2.0 site for benchmarking purposes?
How does you VA take to use SEONuke for pinging, bookmarking, feed submission?
Benchmarking figures would be great and helpful so i can gauge the performance of my VA.
This is actually a very difficult question to answer, because there are many factors that play a role here.
Firstly, it all depends on how many VA's i have available for that particular cycle - this depends on how busy we are with projects. And if it so happens that I only one VA available for a particular cycle, it depends how much I AM willing to help him!
Sometimes, when I got the resources I like to use 3 VA's for one cycle. Then I'll have one content guy start by creating the article, spinning it and then creating the animoto video based on that article. While his doing that, ill have two SEO guys manually create all the accounts that are needed. When the article and video are done, the SEO guys start by first submitting the video to yourtube, then by submitting to all the manual web 2.0's.
While they doing that, my content guy creates the PDF and Slide Show...which the SEO guys submit afterwards. Then the one SEO guy will start with the automated tools, and start the AMR submission and link strengthening while the first guy submits to the blog networks.
If I have more than one VPS available (with the Senukex, AMR and scrapebox), and with some proper planning I can get up to 3 cycles completed in a single day with these three VA's - because they will be working on all three cycles at the same time. BUT in a lot of the cases we will have to complete some of the link strengthening stuff on the second day.
SOMETIMES though, my team might be really busy on other projects and I might only have 1 VA available to complete a cycle. Then the time he takes depends a lot on how much I personally help him, especially with the content creation - this is the biggest time waster.
If you have a WELL-TRAINED (YOU must train him), and experienced VA you could get up to 3 cycles a week out of him. But if his time management is a little bad, (even if he is well trained) you looking at about 2 and a half cycles - the third to be completed the following week.
As you can see, there are MANY things that influence the time it takes your VA to complete your cycles, so I hope this gives you some kind of an idea to create benchmarks for team.
In SenukeX, i simply have my guys add all the AMR urls to the software...then simply tick the box to randomly select two of the URLS to bookmark at each bookmarking site. But only use one set of accounts
If you want to test run senukex, the free trial is a good idea. If you get the hang of it, and want to use it, you can rent it off a server for $30 per month like I did. Not sure if this is legit or not. I do not plan on keeping the service. Easier to just outsource some tasks. Search 'senuke vps' to find providers.
Hi, Nick
Thanks for share your strategies. I have some questions as follow.

these two keywords are the same? if not, you work on only ONE keyword at a time?
5. SenukeX Campaign: I then run an automated web2.0 campaign using SenukeX ("Social Network" Campaign in SenukeX). I use the same Promo article as content, with links in the article body. I DO NOT submit to the same sites I already submitted to manually (Those where the YouTube video was embedded). This normally gives me additional 25 or 26 properties with my article and links.
The same promo atricle is a violation of the positive policy of google?
Do not include links in your content body for AMR blasts. They need to be in a resource box. I normally include two keywords in my resource box - one to my site (target keyword as anchor text) and the other to a random URL of the manual web2.0 sites, including the Docstoc, SlideShare, Scribd and YouTube URL's or an inner page of your site. This can all be randomized using spin syntax.
Why don't include the link in thecontent?
what is a resource box？
I know this question is too simple, but I am a novice, I really do not know it , please show me an example, thank you
The site's main keyword is generally a little more competitive, and general. The internal pages target long tail keywords. The idea is to always be building links to your main site keyword as well, while building links to your internal pages. This way, your main page will always have a lot more backlinks than the individual pages - this looks more natural
Originally Posted by spen

I don't know what is the "google positive policy"?
If however you are talking about duplicate content, that is why we spin the article
Originally Posted by spen

The reason for this is because AMR submits to article directories. And many of these directories do not allow articles to have links in the body.
So there is a place at the end of the article, called the "author resource box" where you can write one or two paragraphs about the author who wrote the article. You may normally include one or two links in this resource box.
An example of a simple resource box may look something like this (keeping to our guitarsite example);
James Johnson is an expert in the field of guitar playing and repairing, and has been an avid enthusiast for 15 years. To learn more about how to play guitar, visit Jame's site for the best guitar chords on the internet
Notice how the blue wording...in a real resource box those would be the links to your site. The "play guitar" would link to guitarsite.com while the "guitar chords" would link to guitarsite.com/guitar-chords
I normally blast to between 60k and 100k blogs. Normally there are a few thousand that are successfully submitted, but this varies greatly, depending on the list im blasting to, my comments, proxies etc etc...
I have no idea how many are auto approved, and how many of them are moderated...i never check
Hi nick! So just wanted to say thanks again for a fantastic post! it has really made a big difference. i tested your seo cycle on a relatively old site of mine, site is about 2 years old. for my main keyword, it's been stuck in position 26 to 30 for the last few months. after doing a seo cycle last week, and after a little dancing its now moved to position 14! im well-chuffed, and best of all i didnt even complete an entire cycle - only pinged the links for the "link stregthening" phase (im lazy, i know!) ;-)
Nice post Nick, I may actually be able to fit this into my current link building strategy
No probs guys, hope you put it to some good use. If you start seeing some results pop back and post about it - we would all love to read about it.

Only one email account needs to be created for each cycle - the same email account is used by all the web2.0 sites to sign up.
Keeping track of all the logins is easy as well, because each cycle will get one username and password that is used to create all the web2.0 accounts. And after a cycle is completed, you dont really need the login details anymore...there's no need to use the accounts again...

Thanks!
Hey bud, normally accounts are created on about 8,000 directories...then i submit to all of them, but only between 1,300 and 2,000 are actually successful. Of these, only between 30 and 50 are auto approved and available immediately to view.
I have no idea how many of the other directories actually approve the articles after a manual review...i have never really bothered checking...
Excellent post, I must say this is much in detail than lots of WSO I have purchase out there. Just one question about the article networks? Can you give me detail on how you post it? I mean, you use 1 network per week or per day? Or are you using all 6 network at the same time? and how offten you post it per week? This will give you lots of backlinks, and don't you think Big G will notice it?
Excellent post. Really helped me to rank few of my sites top Page 1. Thank you
Great! Care to elaborate on your results? We would all love to read about it. Glad my cycles have helped you see results

Thanks,
No probs, im glad you enjoy the strategy. As for the blog networks, I post to all of them at same time - same day. Remember, we are running SEO "CYCLES" here. each cycle gets fully completed before moving on to the next.
As for the big G noticing...im sure they do but I have never had a site penalized before using this strategy - even brand new sites.
I think three things play a really big role here:
1. We use HIGH QUALITY content
2. There is a large diversity of links in each cycle
3. Not all the links are seen by google on the same day...there are many links from AMR and from the blog networks that are left to be found by google over time as they get approved or indexed naturally

That would work, as long as the links are from diverse sources as well. BUT remember, the whole idea is to look natural in google's eyes - high PR links alone do not look natural
I just finished the "manual creation" of the web 2.0 sites for this strategy. Since I have started the keyword that I was targetting has moved from 492 on google, to 12 yesterday, to #8 and first page on google! Now i will move on to the SEONuke stuff, I first need to learn the software
Some lessons learned: Fiverr sucks... do not use fiverr. I have been trying to outsource the manual web 2.0 site creation to a filipino VA, and I am frustrated with the fact that most VA's can't follow instructions.
Nick: How long did it take for you to train your VA to create web 2.0 sites?

Some lessons learned: Fiverr sucks... do not use fiverr. I have been trying to outsource the manual web 2.0 site creation to a filipino VA, and I am frustrated with the fact that most VA's can't follow instructions.
Nick: How long did it take for you to train your VA to create web 2.0 sites?
Sites to avoid: blogetary, tabulas, and docstoc.
WOW...great results! Thanks for sharing. keep us updated on your progress. But remember to add additional pages to your site and keep some links going to it to prevent you from losing ranking - especially if you are targeting a fairly difficult keyword or having long breaks in between the various parts of the cycle
To answer your questions:
To be honest my VA's learn pretty quickly. Just to create the web 2.0 accounts properly (using proxy, clearing cache etc...) will take under a week - 2 or 3 days at most.
But iv'e got various PDF's that I have created to help train my VA's - all with examples, expected time frames etc etc...
It's well worth the time to create similar types of well laid-out training material for your VA's.
Also, when starting with a new VA, it's worth spending a few hours each day with them on skype - constantly making sure they are on the right track. Because a lot of the time with a new VA they are not, and then maybe in half an hour you find out they are doing a task totally wrong - then you correct them. But if you were not on skype, you would have only found out at the end of the day that they spent all day doing it wrong!
In total, a VA will work for me for about 3 weeks before he is at the performance par I need him to be at. This is mainly due to time management skills...
Hey Nick, Is there a reason why you do not use "Article Blasting" via SEONukeX?
I don't think it would hurt, the only reason I don't do that is because there are already plenty of links being built via article directories with AMR...but feel free to add it to your own strategy - but as always, make sure you use decent content!

Thanks, but when this thread was started there was no WSO on the horizon. The only reason I created the WSO is because of this thread - many people have been asking me to run cycles for them via PM - so i set up a small team to do just that!
Nick, spinning articles seems to play a large role in your strategy. You say to manually spin your articles and just keep making new copies of one of your articles.
The best spinner looks likes a great software, but for an alternative, would any spinner work since you are spinning manually anyway? Also, how thoroughly are you spinning your articles?
Also how much are you paying each month for all of the blog networks that you are submitting your articles to? Are the essential to your strategy?
Thanks for your help.
Yes, im sure any spinner will work just as good. I've personally used Magic Article rewriter and spinner chief as well - both work great. I only recommend TBS because i personally prefer it. It helps a lot when "hand spinning" the articles. You can hand spin an entire article by simply pointing and clicking.
I do feel that blog networks are a vital part of my strategy...the simple reason for that is because they provide a great variety of links - from many different types of sites with different PR's.
Thank you for the wealth of information shared here. Quick question in regards to Scribd and SlideShare. So, both of these articles do need to be unique even though they are docs? Also, please let me know how to get a backlink from these 2 properties. I think I figured it out for Sribd but still unclear for SlideShare. I tried to put my url in the description on Slideshare but it is not a clickable hyperlink.
Your back links from slideshare will actually be in one of the slides. Just like a link in an article. When you insert text into one of the slides, just highlight it and hyperlink it. Similar to making a link in a word doc.
Thanks for the great tips on this thread. However I am concerned about the Google dance as it is called. Anything to prevent this? Seems that building links to new or newish sites is a guarantee of the dance. When the site vanishes for up to six months, the traffic also dries up. Should your sytem be reserved for older sites?

Hi, im afraid there's no known way to get around the goolge dance...not that i know of anyway. I think the only thing you could try is to slowly start building links, then gradually increase the links over a few months as the traffic increases. In my opinion this SHOULD give you a slow and gradual increase in rankings - possibly with no google dance, and if there is one it SHOULD be small and of a short duration.
But in most cases when building backlinks you will see some kind of Google dance, though most are not for 6 months! Generally when i build backlinks, i will see a nice jump in rankings within the first week, then after that the rankings will hop around a lot, sometimes falling off the SERPS completely...but then it normally settles near to where it jumped the first time, and gradually gets better from there.
When the site starts in the google dance, I like to add fresh content to the site and then run another round of link building...this helps it settle in a much better position after the dance
I hope this sheds some light buddy, good luck

I heard that SENUKE and AMR don't work that well anymore....? What kind of competition are you up against for these kw's that you've used this method for?
I think if you use them on their own they will not be as effective. The idea with using them with my strategy is that they provide even more link diversity.
Another very important thing to keep in mind is the quality of the content. If you submit poorly spun, un-readable gibberish then obviously you are not going to see good results.
For me, these two pieces of software are very valuable to my overall strategy...

Endre
Hi Endre,
I often use these cycles for brand new sites. BUT when the google dance comes into play I add fresh content to the site and then run another cycle on it...because a lot of times when i dont then either the site ends up on a fairly low position or it loses its rank quickly afterwards
Great thread. Thanks for posting Nick. I have been looking into doing my own ranking and this covers it. Appreciate you sharing this valuable information with the warriors.
Better than most paid courses.
I'm getting ready to launch another site and am going to follow this as closely as possible. I'm already incorporating some of the techniques on others, but not the exact (or extremely close) method. Should be fun to see where it ends up.

Hey guys, thats great. I hope you see some good results. Maybe you guys can compare your results right here on the thread - that would make for an interesting read for us all.
A lot of site owners does not give time to pick keywords and they start working on content and how to get visitors by any mean but if they give a time for picking keywords, they will be surprised by the results.
Your strategy is so important as one of the main reasons to get high ranks to get a lot of visitors to your site is to start from the scratch by picking the most suitable keyword to your site or by your way to add articles that contains rich keywords then you start to promote for the site content.
A lot of site owners does not give time to pick keywords and they start working on content and how to get visitors by any mean but if they give a time for picking keywords, they will be surprised by the results...
This is actually an EXTREMELY good point! Thanks for bringing it up.
I know this has been mentioned before, but as it is THE MOST IMPORTANT part of any SEO effort - it is definitely worth talking about again.
Guys, for ANY SEO strategy to work effectively (including mine) - you need to do your keyword research correctly.
If you target a one-word keyword with 50 million, well-optimized authority competitors - you can bet your life one or two of my little cycles is probably not even going to get you indexed for the keyword!! Especially if you are trying to rank a one-page micro niche site!
When doing your keyword research, there are always 3 basic things you need to look for:
1. Amount of searches and hence, traffic - obviously its probably not going to be worth your while to target an 8-word longtail keyword that only 5 people search for every month! Make sure the keyword you want to target gets enough searches to be worth your while.
2. Competition - Traditionally marketers look at the AMOUNT of competition. It issupposed to be used to reduce the time you take on keyword research. If a keyword has few competitors, generally its a sign of weak competition - and you can continue analyzing it. But if it has a lot of competitors, generally it means it's a tough keyword - and you can stop right there and move on to the next keyword.
This can be a good starting point, but by no means THE point. You STILL need to go and analyze HOW STRONG that competition is. And this is where so many marketers fall short. They see a particular keyword only has 15,000 competing pages and they immediately target it - without first analyzing how strong that competition is.
No point targeting a keyword because its only got 100 competing pages - but all these pages are PR8 - 10 authority sites! (Not that thats really possible, but you get the point!)
At the same time, A LOT of competition does not ALWAYS mean the keyword is difficult to target. (Mostly it does, but not always). If your keyword has 10 million competing pages - but not a single one of them is in anyway optimized for your keyword, and they are all PR0 - then you could probably rank in the number 1 spot by simply optimizing your page well and building 5 backlinks!
So always, always, always check the top 10 competitors - These are the guys currently ranking in the top 10 positions for the keyword in consideration. If you think you can outrank one of them, you got yourself a target keyword!
3. Commercial Value (as they call it) - This is basically the value of the keyword, and means different things to different people. It all depends on what you want to use the keyword for and basically revolves around selecting relevant keywords for your projects.
If you are an adsense marketer, make sure the keyword has a decent CPC, because you know you are going to get about 68% of that.
If you are an affiliate marketer, make sure that people searching for that particular term are in the final stage of the buying cycle. i.e make sure they are done browsing for information, and they are now ready to buy! Most importantly, make sure they are not "freebie seekers" - no point getting 1,000 visitors a day to your website all looking for FREE software that you are selling for $500! you pretty sure not to get a single sale!
If you are building a list, make sure that people searching for the term are interested in more information in your niche. So that when you entice them with the free report/ebook or whatever - they will gladly join your list to get it.
Guys I know I kinda went on rambling here. But I hope you guys all see how important your keyword research is. It really is the foundation of any campaign. If you get any part of it wrong, some aspect of your campaign will not work properly - either you will not get traffic, or you will get too little, or your traffic wont convert etc... So spend enough time on your keyword research, and remember to carry out each step with a reason. NEVER EVER pick your keywords blindly and without a good reason.
Just one more quick question for you, do you put all your videos under 1 youtube account or create multiple accounts?
I believe Nick uses the same accounts for each cycle per website. When he starts a new site then he creates new accounts. This way, you are posting relevant, similar content and videos to those accounts.
Should I set the site up with the ads, amazon links and banners etc. from the start? Or should I go thru one cycle first, just to rank?
Endre
Personally I wait at least a month or so before adding links and ads. BUT to be honest i have not really tested the difference between the two approaches (Maybe you can enlighten us all with your results). But as dollar_bill said, id rather be safe than sorry

That's the way to do it. Although if i'm doing more than 10 videos per niche I'll split them up into multiple accounts just to be safe.
IMO once people have some experience in SEO they should pick a profitable but (relatively) hard KW and spend money on backlinks. Ranking cheap low-comp KWs isn't the way to become rich but it is a good way to start.
Anyway, this strategy does work and I've been using it (or a variation of it) ever since I saw it on the BHW forum (it's originally by cash202). The key is link variety. Web 2.0s are awesome. By using large enough quantities of Web 2.0s you can rank for ANY KW.
Keyword research is something that people spend a lot less time on than they should.
If you don't mind me asking, what's the minimum exact searches per month (global or local?) that you look for before considering a keyword?
Also, once you reach page one (and I know you probably have), has has the the amount of visitors you received differed from what was stated in the keyword search tool?
Yeah, as i said keyword research is the foundation of your entire campaign..
The keyword criteria i personally use depends largely on what my goals are for the site. But generally I try go for keywords with a least 1,600 exact global searches. These types of keywords NORMALLY (not always) give me about 100 visitors a day with page 1 rankings.
And yes, i ALWAYS see differences in the amount of traffic I really get compared to the Adwords tool. In some instances the difference is HUGE...and can swing either way (more / or less - more often less) than the quoted amount on the adwords keyword tool. But its pretty much the only data we have to work with, so its what i use.
To be honest I think the only way a person can really be sure before building the site is to set up an adwords campaign, bid high and be sure to be number 1 and then see for yourself over a few days how much traffic the keyword REALLY gets. For me though, this approach is too time-consuming and expensive for the long tails i target. It would be well worth it though if targeting difficult, high traffic, high value keywords.

I totally agree, and i do the same thing. If start having too much content submitted with one account, i create another - even if its for the same site / campaign

This is also a good approach, but not one that I totally agree with. Might be because I have never really targeted a very difficult / high value keyword before.
But the problem in doing that, is that it becomes a lot more difficult to KEEP your rankings. You will always be up against authority sites, who are constantly getting fresh content to their sites everyday. It will take a lot more work, time, effort and money to KEEP your site ranked on page 1.
And, your risk is higher. Not only because its easier to loose your rankings, but because most of your money will come from one site. If you loose your position - you loose most of your cash flow with it.
If you don't mind me throwing up another question, what has your experience been unseating sites like Amazon, Walmart, etc. for products? Is it fairly easy, or does it take a lot of time and effort.
The reason I ask is because although the sites are large, and have millions of backlinks, the PAGES you are competing against usually have very little in the way of backlinks, especially for the targeted kewords. What's you're take on this?

Again this normally depends on the other pages that are ranking as well. But generally i can out rank an amazon product page fairly easily...
Quality optimized content, regular updates on your page, and good backlinks and you should be able to outrank them quite quickly
Nick is right. Outranking Amazon, Walmart, etc, isn't as hard as you'd think. And actually, it's usually an indicator that Google has nothing better to show so it goes with the traditional authority sites. A properly optimized site / page can outrank these with a little bit of work.
Quality optimized content, regular updates on your page, and good backlinks and you should be able to outrank them quite quickly.
I keep seeing you speak about regularly updating the page you are working one. I think this as another one of those things that is oftentimes overlooked. I think a lot of people put up a webpage and then just let it sit. From what you say, constantly updating your page with new content helps it to rank faster (and not dance as much). Perhaps this shows Google that you're not just spamming links, but are instead trying to build up the quality of your site.
Now, when you update your content, do you remove the existing content, or just add to it? Doesn't it become impractical after a while? I mean, won't the page turn into a large wall of text on top of text? Do you make the additions look like separate articles, or to you make it look like you are adding onto existing articles?

Good question. I'd also like to know this.
Of course, the authority sites are always removing content and replacing it with new but I'm a little skittish about removing some of my own content,

Firstly, it is definitely possible to add a single page of content to a site, do some decent link building and have that one page rank - and then you never have to touch it again.
BUT, there are two things that play a role here:
1. You rank much easier when first adding fresh content to your site. This is especially true when targeting more difficult keywords
2. Adding fresh content helps you KEEP your current ranking! Again, especially true when targeting more difficult keywords. Because more difficult keywords naturally have more people trying to compete for them, so if you just got one page with the same old content ranking, then Google will probably give your position to the next guy that comes along with a page that gets a new article added once a week!
Now, with me personally, i do not remove content from sites - ever
Normally, id add a decent article with pics and maybe a video...do some link building, then add some more content - sometimes in the form of additional pics, or added YouTube videos - mostly accompanied by one or two paragraphs of fresh text - and then do some more link building.
Then i would have another page, on the same site where i do the same thing...and so I would carry on until i have targeted all my keywords.
So one single page never really has endless amounts of information on it. I always stop before...but the site as a whole keeps getting updated with new content - so i keep getting "brownie points" with google.
Once the site is done, and i feel i have targeted all the keywords i want to target...then i leave it just as it is...no added content or links. I might do the odd SEO cycle here and there to maintain rankings though, but thats it.
If i were targeting more difficult keywords that would require more content, im sure my approach would be different...because i would need to add a whole lot more fresh content to my sites...but i dont have that problem because i target mostly easy to medium difficulty keywords
I hope this makes, and helps clear up your concerns about fresh content
Ok so I've been following this thread with great interested since Nick started it and obviously I had to test his step by step system by myself. I'm going to provide my feedback and results so far, taking into account that I've just completed my first full cycle yesterday and results probably haven't fully kicked in yet.
I chose to try and optimize my site for a highly competitive keyword and for a secondary less competitive one that has a lot of variations I could target all at once.
These are the steps I took and my expenses for this cycle(minus cost of all required software):
Content Creation:
1. I had 2 original articles written for $5 each on Fiverr and I manually added spintax to them with the help of Spinner Chief (free version). Even though I do have AMR, I find Spinner Chief to be a better solution for manually adding syntax to your article. Both articles were manually spun to about 75% each.
2. I had the first article read by a professional voice actor for $5 on Fiverr, resulting in a 2 minute recording. Then I hired another provider for $15 to add images and captions to that recording, thus making a 2 minute video out of it for my cycle.
3. Next up was the content submission part of the Cycle. I manually uploaded the Youtube video, created the SlideShare and Scribd files, and each of the web 2.0 submissions, adding unique versions of the second article in each. I included 2 links in each submission, the first one with my main keyword to my main page, the second with my secondary keyword and secondary page. I also embeded the youtube vid in each. Out of all the manual web2.0 submissions, only squidoo and wikia deleted them so all in all I think it was a pretty good "stick" rate.
4. For the Blog Network part of the cycle, I didn't want to subscribe to all those networks even though I know they are very good, I decided to pay two people on Fiverr to submit to one private Network with high PR posts (I got 80 of them) and another one to submit to ALN. This is basically the only step I didn't do 100% as Nick suggested, however I am currently paying someone $125 for a month long drip of article submissions to a private network with very high PR blogs.
5. I registered with Senuke X and did the Social Network campagin, getting 14 properties in the process, a bit lower than I expected but it's still good. I also registered with Squidproxies for 10 private proxies at $24/month.
6. For the AMR blast I used the first article(in spintax form obviously) which was the one I had used for the video creation. I wanted to have 2 different articles so that one of them was used for the manual web2.0 submission and also because this way the video and content on those properties wouldn't be basically the same thing. I managed to get 120 auto approved submissions from a list of 7k directories (after trimming it down from about 100k directories I found/payed for). I used the same 2 links in the resource as in my manual web 2.0 submissions, first one with my main keyword and main url, second with secondary keyword and URL.
Link Strengthening:
7. Did all the steps as explained by Nick. I thoroughly social bookmarked all manually created web2.0 properties plus the video and scribd and slide share files.
8. I did a quick social bookmark of the AMR auto approved articles as well, and as an extra I did the same thing with the 80 blog network links that were created from that Fiverr gig.
9. Created the RSS feeds, including the 80 blog network links as well, ended up with exactly 5 Feeds that I used in the RSS Senuke campagin.
10. Did a 140k Scrape Box blast to all the manually created pages, senuke created pages, all the AMR links and 80 blog network links. I didn't do a blast directly to the money site as I really doubt that would have benefited my website. Even though the domain is 4 years old with a PR of 2, I was trying to rank 2 article pages basically in this cycle and was afraid of getting sandboxed.
So that's all I did for the cycle, it took me a bit over 1 week to complete it but that was only because it was my first cycle and I had to learn and understand how to do everything, also I had to look for and trim down lists of article directories and scrape box lists and that took me a while as well.
Now for the results. Let me mention that the main article page with the main keyword was a new page and the keyword highly competitive, while the secondary page was a few months old and it was standing on the second page of Google for that keyword and 4 other variations.
The main keyword at the time of this writing is only sitting on page 18. This is not really unexpected, I didn't believe it would work its way up that fast considering the competition, about 100k in quotes for the main keyword. I'm also aware that I didn't complete the Blog Network part of the cycle and that I've just ordered the month long drip to the private blog network I mentioned - I expect the site to continue moving up though.
The secondary keyword and it's variations however are ALL on the first page of Google, they moved there 2 days ago when I was about to finish my cycle. They are currently standing between #4 - #8 and even though these keywords don't receive as much traffic as my main one, it's still a nice increase in rankings and traffic. I was trying to get these keywords on the first page for a while now, nice to see them finally taking their rightful place.
So bottom line, the cycle works very well for medium to low competition keywords, you can probably reach the first page with just one cycle, exactly as Nick mentioned throughout this thread. For highly competitive keywords however you definitely need more than one as it is to be expected. Here's how the competition looks for my main keyword(top 10 sites):
Spots #3 and #4 don't look that hard to beat according to the numbers, also notice that only 2 out of 10 websites have the keyword in their title and url. I assume the high PR blog drip + one or two more cycles will get me to the first page, what do you think?
I am satisfied with the results I got and now will await to see how the rankings evolve over the next couple of weeks.
Hope you guys find this feedback valuable, as I have found Nick's thorough advice. Thanks again for posting this, you really helped a lot of people get closer to the first page of Google :-).
If there's anything I did wrong or could have done better, I would really appreciate your feedback Nick.
Edit: I just realized my site moved up to the first page for my main keyword on Yahoo. Nice!

WOW! What a great post! Thank you so much for coming back and sharing your results in so much detail, im sure many here apprciate it - i sure do
Razvan, you ask "If there's anything I did wrong or could have done better" - the answer, there's not! As a matter of fact you over delivered in every way, and to be honest you doing the cycles even more thoroughly than I am!!
You must remember, the main goal with these cycles are to create link diversity and link velocity. Both of which, i think, you have successfully done. There's no RIGHT or WRONG...so i think you did a fantastic job...and you will definitely reap the rewards of your hard work...

Nick
Nick, you mentioned this once before. I know that link velocity is how fast you get links. However, you seem to indicate that it doesn't matter how fast you get your links since you said that one of these cycles could be accomplished in 2 once you do a few. Is it better to do a cycle over a shorter period of time or a longer period of time, like a week?

Thanks for your thoughts on link velocity.
Yes you are correct, but remember that link velocity counts when GOOGLE sees those links. So in these cycles the link velocity is being created by the blog networks and by AMR.
Not all the blog networks distribute your content immediately. And even those that do, the blogs that your content lands on might take some time to get indexed or crawled again. And with AMR there are generally a small number of directories that auto approve your articles, the rest get approved over time as they are approved.
Also, the pages that we just leave on their on, with no intentional effort to get them indexed normally also take a while to be crawled again / or indexed and so thats the point when Google actually finds the links.
Then there's also the fact that 90% of the time more than 1 cycle is completed for a single site...creating even more links being found randomly over time by Google...
So even though the entire cycle might be completed in a day or two, and google will certainly find a majority of the links immediately (or pretty soon after creation) - there are still plenty that take some time to be found.
So in my opinion, Razvan created link velocity by having a successful AMR campaign and paying someone to drip links to his site over a month. And to top it off, his planning on running another 1 or 2 cycles!
Thanks a lot, Nick, for going in-depth on what you do as far as adding content goes. You explained a lot and described exactly what you do and to what degree you do it. Now I see what you mean by updating your content.
Thanks, Nick. That really helped alot. I forgot about the fact that Google doesn't' see every link as soon as it's created.
You mentioned that you use AMR, is that the best article submission software you've found, or haven't you tried any others?
Thanks for staying so dedicated to this thread. Also, thanks for the tips on outsourcing. I think that is really where you will start to see large scale results with this technique.
yeah no worries, as long as the thread ends up helping a few people (which i know it has) - it makes it all worth while.
As for article distribution software, i have only really worked with AMR - i did briefly try out Magic Article Submitter, but personally i prefer AMR. The only reason being iv'e become so accustomed to using it...im sure MAS is just as good a tool in capable hands...
Question for anyone. If I am in the US and I do a search for a certain key phrase, the results are a .co.uk website takes up 5 out of the top 6 spots. Does this mean there is very little competition for this phrase?

No buddy im afraid not...thats like saying the number 1 spot is a .net domain so its gota be low competition.
I would do keyword research exactly the same as i normally would.

Hi guys, so its been a little over a month since I last updated everyone on the case study we did.
Quick Re-cap For those of you that have not been following the case study, I thought I'd just give a very brief run down.
Basically I created a 1 page EMD site in the pregnancy niche. The site is based on word press, contains one page of content, and then all the standard privacy policy etc...pages
It is targeting 2 keywords...the one is a fairly easy longtail keyword consisting of 4 words, and the other is a much broader phrase of the same term, with a lot more competition
When we first built this site, we ran ONE cycle on it, and within 4 days it reached page 1 in google. I kinda got started with another cycle, but then pulled my guys off of it to work on other projects.
If you would like more details, just go back in the thread and read the case study updates.
Performance Right guys, about a month ago when posted the last update, the site was at about position 5 to 6 for the main keyword. I was getting between 60 and 120 uniques a day
The other day I noticed I had a nice little increase in traffic, I was getting a consistent 150 to 170 uniques a day. So i checked my rankings. The site is now hovering between position 3 and 4 for its main target keyword. And there's no doubt in my mind that another full cycle will push me right to the top!
If i were to run a cycle targeting the secondary keyword, and got that to the first page as well, im sure ill get tons more traffic as its a very broad term.
If you guys want more details about this case study, please go back in the thread and read the case study updates
Sorry if this isn't a good post or if it's been answered... I'm sure I could probably find the answer somewhere, but when you say spun to atleast 50% uniqueness what exactly does that mean and how do I check that. That's the main part I'm confused about.
Also, in regards to the youtube video. Should the youtube video be targeting our keyword or no?
Alright I'm back with my results, but only because I know Nick wants it and he sure helped me ;-)
My keyword was already on the first page of Google at position 7, but I didn't really get any visitors from it, so I asked Nick what I should do if it already was on the first page of Google and he quickly replied, where he told me what to do.
So I made a full cycle about a month ago, except for some of the blog networks I couldn't afford.
After I made the cycle I basically just waited and I'm here now one month later and my current result is from position 7 to position 1.
So guys, this really works just put some time and effort in it and I'm sure you'll see results too :-)

Fantastic results buddy! Thank you so much for sharing it with us all! I'm sure it will be an inspiration for many members here.
I started my cycle today (very competitive KW and I currently am stuck at #5) and it is a lot of work, let me tell you but I know it will be worth it. It actually feels good to be doing all this manually again...been so long since I did anything manual. This is nice to be able to build all these web 2.0 sites the way I want them built and making them look good. Using software you cant really achieve this, I have senukex and it doesn't build them as good as I can manually build them.
I created a video and it is already ranked #8 for videos (in just 2 hours) for very competitive word. I also did the pdf, PowerPoint, and posted to 3 web 2 sites. Still have lots more to do.
I will post my results in a few weeks! Thank you very much for this amazing post, you could have easily sold this strategy for $10-$20 but I know you are already successful and don't need to. Thanks again for awesome info and strategy!!!
Note---If you do sell a product I will be there to buy it
Tip---Spinner Chief is the best manual spinner on the market.(free version is awesome) I have several others and they all have something they are the best at. In this case, my software I use for one-click spins that makes articles probably 85% readable was not used. I am doing exactly what Nick says to do.
Nick, when you do a manual spin to 50% uniqueness, how many times do you think you can spin the article until you start to lose that 50% uniqueness? I mean, how many copies do you get out of one article? Also, do you spin sentences, phrases, or individual sentences?

Thanks a lot.
I got no idea on how many you can actually get out of one article like that...ive never tested it. I Only use it for one cycle, never more.
But if you include it in the AMR blast, then you will probably get some articles that are very similar...
I spin at the word / phrase level. And then I write out 3 titles for the article and spin each individually at word level - then spin them together. So at any point, either of the 3 versions are used...this way your titles tend to stay quite unique.
Something worth mentioning about this as well...if you want to outsource, dont just assume that the writer can effctively spin your content. I've had plenty of writers that say they will hand spin the content, but when I receive it back it looks as if it was simply put through TBS and 5 synonyms were chosen...most of the article doesnt make sense when you spin it...So test your writers carefully
If you can't afford the crazy price you can always use something like roboform to make the 2.0s. It will be more time consuming but you can setup a full profile, change a lot of the default looks and still do the same thing!
Hello thanks for your method, Regarding your last step. It looks very strenuous, i mean is it compulsory? (is it main one?) . In fiverr and all i can only see gigs with people willing to blast only one url or like 50 urls
Assuming there will be around 5k links to blast, i assume it'd take around a year to that ( I never used scrapebox or xrumer correct me if i was wrong).
And how many blasts are required, 1k is enough or more is required, how much do you do personally
Hi, the scrapebox blast does not get done individually for EACH URL. What I do is simply plug ALL URLS into one blast. So scrapebox randomly builds links to the URLs. Sure, some of them end up not getting any links, but most will have at least 1 or 2 links built to them..
Well i don't have a vps, so i need to outsource this scrapebox blast to fiverr, and many of the gigs say 10k blasts to 25 url e.t.c e.t.c, I will request a gig, so how much blast do i require?
Don't make too much out of this buddy. The reason for the scrapebox blast is to have some links to your web2.0 properties as well. It's just to give that little extra link juice, so that you did not just build 500 links to your site, but there is absolutely nothing linking to ANY of those pages...it makes things look a little more natural as well.
Normally i do a large blast of about 100K or 150K....But again, a smaller blast will also work. Or even an xrumer blast...the idea is just to get some links to the properties you have built...
I did apply your strategy to the T. I wanted to know if you experience a drop in your rankings after 2 weeks? My keywords were in the 3rd to 4th page of Google and is more than a year with a lot of unique contents. After 2 weeks, the rankings dropped and they are now in the 10th and 11th page.

I'm really worried, but is this something you've experience before?
Any feedback will be highly appreciated.
Hi...and yes this is quite common...normally due to the Google dance. Often i see a fairly large drop in rankings and then after a few weeks it's followed by a nice increase where it normally settles in a position better than where it was before.
If you are targeting a fairly difficult keyword though i highly recommend adding new, fresh content to your site...and then running another cycle...this normally brings it into a great position, and does it much faster...
Yes I did see that it is creeping back up. It's now on position 53 and the number of backlinks showing on my MS is now 540 (last time it was 240) and I have a higher page rank from 1 to 2.
I'll add fresh content and run a new cycle. Thank you for all your great help.

Thanks bro. I will try this out on one of my sites and see how well it works
Glad you find it useful...be sure to pop back and post any results you may be having...

True, Senuke is pricey...but should be able to make your money back within a month or two if you use it properly. Or you can do as mentioned above, use roboform to create accounts etc...
If you have the time to invest, it might even be worth getting uBot...and then simply create your own bots to create accounts and post content...its very time consuming though...especially to maintain it to ensure it keeps working when sites change things around...

So far not. I have not received any messages of unnatural links on any of my sites. I do think though that the variety of links helps in this regard.
But i think as time progresses we are all going to need to spend more time and money in covering our tracks with our SEO efforts, and making our backlinks look more natural. Google is becoming smarter by the minute...and i think a very important aspect in this regard is the anchor text we use.
Normally a link building campaign concentrates purely on our target keywords as anchor text...but i think in the future we will need to start including random other anchor texts like "CLICK HERE"...or "THIS SITE"...and even put some effort into getting links from no follow sources as well...all this makes the linking structure look more natural...
Um just a quick question, is it worth it to create a powerpoint, pdf, and youtube video and post them to scribd, slide share, and youtube. I tried it recently and had a hard time adding links to my site in the article description. Also a large majority of them seem to be nofollow. Is this step more for organic traffic or what reason?

You might get some traffic from these sources, but not only that...they are meant to diversify your links even more. And by embedding the video in the web2.0 properties, you also have better quality content on the web 2.0 properties - this is good, because your links are in this content.
Hey Nick, I will be buying some of your cycles soon (the offer you have in your sig).
Just a quick question:
Is the offer in your sig the same exact process that you talked about & laid out in the first post of this thread?
Also, how many cycles would you say it usually takes on average, to rank for a low-medium competition keyword?
Also, one last very important question:
Do you rank more than one inner page on a site? Or do you just target 1 main keyword on each site?
I was thinking about doing a site with 3-5 main keywords, and each main keyword would be a subpage/inner page. Does this actually work? Or would I end up building too many links to a site that way, and sandboxing the heck out of it?
Do you ever do that? Or do you just have 1 main keyword per site, then target lower competition/volume keywords on the rest of the subpages?

It is VERY similar. But because we are now doing many, many more cycles, we had to change the way we do them a little. This is mainly to keep the costs down for people wanting to purchase them.
The first difference is that we don't use manual Web2.0's in the service. We use software to create the accounts and submit the content, BUT we are still able to embed a picture and the youtube video in most of the pages. So the end result, is pretty much the exact same thing as what you get here - some web2.0s with a video and pic, and some without.
The only other major difference in the service, is that we use Social Bookmarking to your money site, as apposed to only for link strengthening - like in this thread.
In the end, the two strategies are very, very similar...and we have been seeing excellent results on our client's sites on the service.

This is a VERY difficult question to answer. Because there are SO MANY variables that affect each situation in a different way - I could not really give you an accurate answer.
If you have a very easy keyword, with virtually no competition and your page is well optimized - then 1 cycle should get you on the first page. But the worse your page is optimized, or tougher your competitors are - the more cycles you will need.
Sometimes a medium competition keyword could take 3 cycles before its at the top...sometimes you target a medium competition keyword, only to find that some of the top 10 sites are too much of authority type sites and it takes 15 cycles...
The quality of content on your page, and the amount of times you update your content also play a major role.

I almost always target multiple keywords on multiple inner pages. But normally I would target a fairly difficult, broad keyword on my home page...then each cycle will target the inner page with its specific keyword - but also the main home page with its more difficult keyword.
As more and more cycles get done for multiple pages - you end up with a lot more links to your home page than to any one individual inner page. This makes your overall site link structure look a lot more natural - and you get to rank multiple pages for multiple keywords - and if you lucky, your home page might even rank for the difficult keyword.
After sometime, you will notice you get a lot of traffic from long tail variations of your actual target keywords.
With all the deindexing on the private blog network what do you recommend on doing to supplement that void?
If the blog networks that you use are being deindexed, then it might be worth trying multiple other networks - or maybe doing press releases, or even some profile links.
The main idea is just to keep a diverse range of links. So do not just go and build more web2.0's for example in the place of your deindexed blog network. Rather, build something that is different to what you already do.
Just be careful with spammy links - link forum profiles, or blog comments. Do not build too many of these types of links.
Great post Nick! I'm working on a similar cycle using nichedog's seo method that utilizes many of the key principles that you employ. However his is far less detailed than your method, so I think I might adopt your strategies. Thanks for taking the time to post your seo strategies, keep up the good work.

Guys...thanks for you interest in my service. BUT i really, really do not want this thread to become some kind of support / sales thread for my service.
Can we please keep any questions relating to my service on my WSO sales thread - the link is in my sig. Just post there, or send me a pm
I would really like to keep this thread just full of good information

I started a new SEO link building strategy based on some of your ideas as well as a few others to promote my new website. Please take a look and let me know what you think. Thanks.
Step 1: Create Articles, Videos, and Images
500+ word high quality article relating to your main keywords.
Create 1 PDF file of Article and submit to Scribd.com
each page of your PDF and PowerPoint presentation contains links to the money site
Create 1 Power Point Slideshow (20-30 slides) and submit to SlideShare.com
Crete 1-2 minute video using Animoto.com and submit it to YouTube.com
Cut Animoto logo with Sony Vegas HD and also add watermark with money site link.
In description field use your money site URL and some descriptive text preferably containing your keyword. It should look something like this (URL first, then description).
Step 2: Article Submission
Web 2.0 Sites
MANUALLY submit 50% spun version of your article together with embedded YouTube video to the following Web 2.0 sites: Squidoo, Hubpages, Weebly, Wikia, Wetpaint, Wikispaces, Posterous, Tumblr, Wordpress, Blogspot, Bukisa, Zimbio, Skyrock, MyLivePage and any other Web 2.0 site not supported by SENuke that you know.
use TWO links in each article, both pointing to a random page on a money site or to the root of the money site (I rotate URLs using spinner syntax).
I am just curious, I used a bunch of SEO "tools" over the past several years. What I noticed is that the learning curve for most is anywhere from pretty easy to "who came up with this scripting language!!!!" i have been a programmer for several years and in the beginning it took a little while to learn languages like C and C#, but with all the built in help these days, it should be just as quick for a newbie to learn some programming and do their own scripts rather than use something like Zenno or Ubot. I just wrote a Proxy Switcher and put it on the market, it took less than one hour to complete and was(in my opinion) just as easy as doing a bot from software. Why is it people are so willing to pay upwards of $75 for Ubot or Zenno and still have to learn all the scripting?

I know what you're saying.
But Ubot appeals to most people who don't know how to program, and those who don't want to have to learn a programming language.
wow... it is great post i have ever read about seo tactic and strategies, will need more time, money and other... but that is normal for great seo strategy and will get great result on serp... Thanks a lot for the share very usefull
I was looking for an SEO case study and this seems to hit the mark. I read the entire thread over 2 days and have learned loads even though I had heard some of the principles before. I may collaborate with some fellow marketers and share the cost of software subscriptions infuture. They seem pretty awesome. Thanks for all the top info and please ignore the "haters".

How long did it take you to learn and practice C and C# before you could use it effectively? A year? Maybe more?
I have used uBot in the past (With no previous programming experience) - and within a few days I had a couple of very useful bots up and running.
uBot and the like will appeal to people with little programming knowledge and who dont particularly want to learn an entire programming language.
Hello Nick!
As you know i have already ordered one of your cycle as a test (wasnt delivered yet) but i wanted went trough the process at least once, so i though i could share my results with you an others.
My keyword has 19 000 exact month searches with 1$ CPC.
I have started with one page (1200 word) and added two post (500 word each yesterday)
I did 18 manual web 2.0 with uniquely written (cheap 1,5$ but readable, 50 score on grammarly) articles + youtube video + pics + scribd + slideshare. I did thorough social bookmarking campaign for 10 of them till now ( i always wait till they are indexed). Also did RSS and submit to 15 aggregators.
After this was completed, my site ranks 23 for main keyword after 3 days.
I have ordered 20 PR1-PR6 on site comments from trustworthy provider, they will be delivered in next days. Im also considering to do manual profile link wheel to add link diversity + some wiki edu links etc.
Do you think that progress from nowhere to position 23 in google for 19 000 exact match keyword can be marked as SUCCESS considering other part of strategy like AMR etc. wasnt yet indexed?
One more thing: If you Nick (or other guys) are interested i could post my progress here. So let me know, dont want to spam it here
Lol. Wow ,as mentioned by others this is exactly the same in most part to "cash202" post on another forum.....there was a guy on that forum who happened to be the only member hating on the method then he got banned...just at the time of his banning this thread popped up.....the guy that was banned and hating on the thread went by the name of Nick too. Twilight do do do do. ;-)
P.s In no way am i trying to state you are the same guy i am just letting you know that perhaps you should change your username lol. In all seriousness great guide, have bookmarked as in secobd inspection it is different from that on the other forum. Keep up the good work ;-)

Hey buddy. Thanks for the results, and sure it would be great to read about your progress here. Feel free to post updates!
Regarding your campaign, considering you went from no where to position 23 in 3 days - YES i do think the link building was a success! You must remember, it has not been very long for the rest of the links to get indexed...and your site still needs to go through the Google dance etc...
Generally after 2 to 3 weeks you will be able to see the real position - but it's almost always better than the initial rankings (i.e. your 23). After this time if you are still not on page 1, add some more content and then build some more links!
I like your way thinking by the way - always try and keep link diversity! Great link building buddy!

Thanks - as for the username thing, thats just one too many coincidences. I'm pretty sure someone is out to sabotage me!
No problem Nick. Again, I wasn't trying to point the finger at you , just making light heart of the situation as members on other forums don't really have anything positive to say and judging by a few posts back some people really are ungrateful.
Keep up the good work, I am testing your method on one site as we speak will report my findings asap.

Regarding your campaign, considering you went from no where to position 23 in 3 days - YES i do think the link building was a success! You must remember, it has not been very long for the rest of the links to get indexed...and your site still needs to go through the Google dance etc...
Generally after 2 to 3 weeks you will be able to see the real position - but it's almost always better than the initial rankings (i.e. your 23). After this time if you are still not on page 1, add some more content and then build some more links!

Just thought I would post an update on what's done so far. Testing this on a site that is 2 years old and for a keyword which I reckon is medium to Hard difficulty.
Completed all steps exactly as you have mentioned and my keyword has jumped from position 15 to position 6 on the first page! This is quite a surprise for me for the site to move up so quickly and this was within 4 days of completing the first cycle. I could have completed this cycle in 2 days or even 1 but been so busy with building out a clients site I thought it would be interesting to see what results I could get. What's even more surprising is that I hadn't even completed the scrapebox part as I wasn't sure as to how to blast the URLS.
For example, I have a 200K auto approve list, do I do one submission to each URL mentioned with the full list or do I share all the URLS with the 200k list?
I think I would get even greater results had I completed this step, I am going to move on to another keyword and see what happens with that. Impressed so far.
P.S Forgive my grammer, I am sending this out from my iphone and I still can't get used to this on screen keyboard crap :-)

Wow thats fantastic results! considering your keyword is medium to difficult I think something that really helped you a lot was that the site is so well aged. Great results.
As for the scrapebox blast - what i do is simply plug all the URL's in - and blast to all of them. Scrapebox will randomly select one of the URL's each time for a comment...I think doing a complete 200k blast for each is a little overkill
Guys I thought I would post an update on case study site we started earlier in this thread.
Quick re-cap
I started a small site in the pregnancy niche, and targeted 2 keywords - a long tail keyword (consisting of 4 words) and a shorter (more difficult) version of that long tail keyword (consisting of 2 words)
I ran one cycle after the site was created and landed on page 1 for the long tail after 4 days.
I got started on a second cycle, but never finished it. At the last update of this case study, I was at about position 4 for the long tail and position 12 or 13 for the more difficult keyword.
What I've done since
Since the last update, I went ahead and completed another full cycle for this site.
So in total, I have completed 2 and a half cycles.
For the last week or so, my rankings have improved drastically and I am number 1 for the long tail version of the keyword and number 3 for the more difficult keyword.
My traffic has also seen a nice jump - where I was getting about 120 visitors a day before, I am now getting up to 400 visitors a day!
At the moment it's too soon to tell how long I will keep these rankings, and there has not really been much of a Google dance. But im hoping that both the keywords stay at least top 5.
If there are any significant changes, ill be sure to update you guys here

Has anyone seen this message in their WMT before? Most of the time we all dread a message from the big G. I was even worried when I first seen this in my account. Then I saw the 'Yay!' at the end, and knew that this was good news. I have done two 'juicier' cycles so far. It took me 2 months but that's ok. My site is sticking at #8 so far. My key phrase has 22K local searches per month and 110K results with quotes.

Yeah I've got the same thing before...much better than the "unnatural links" notification i can imagine
Have you tried it without using SENuke? I don't have it, and will not be getting it unless I can be convinced it really is worth $147 or whatever it is a month.
The manual 2.0's are the strong properties, will it be effective without the additional 2.0's?
I have other resources to bookmark url's, so wouldn't need it for that...I'm just wondering in your testing of your method if you've done it without using SENuke.
~Mike
Mike, I have always used Senuke - but if you can get at least 20 or so web 2.0's I think you will see pretty much the same results. Or it might even be worth paying someone to do the Senuke campaigns for you
Hello Nick..Sorry for asking you..I just want to know why we have to submit content to Scribd and SlideShare. Because i've done that and the backlinks from these sites not indexed by google neither alexa...
it's very excellent...I've just got very valuable SEO science...Thank you guys..U're very kind to share the secret to us..

the idea behind slideshare and scribd is just to give you more link diversity. Try running social bookmarks, scrapebox, rss feeds etc to try and get Google to index the document pages
1. Thorough Social Bookmarking campaign. Use SenukeX or Book Marking Demon and social bookmark the following URL’s to all the Social Bookmarking sites:
a. All Manually Created Web2.0 pages
b. YouTube Video URL
c. SlideShare, Docstoc and Scribd pages
How many random links per bookmarking site do we use in the senuke bookmark settings? (default is 2)
Edit: just watched a senuke video and it said not to bookmark more than 3 websites per bookmarking site, as most bookmarking sites don't allow anymore than that, and I have 40 urls from the web 2.0 properties. Any suggestions?
No shortcuts. Took me awhile to figure that out myself. But once you do, you'll starting seeing success.
This is so true! Work hard, stick to a proven plan and you WILL see success! Problem with IM is that people think its the "easy" way out!

I don't usually try to up the ranks on my individual YT videos. But if you were doing video marketing, and targeting a specific keyword in your video etc...I would imagine just using the YT video URL and build links to it.
But then again YT rankings could be a whole other ball game, as you have to consider comments, likes etc...you you could also embed the video in as much viewed content as possible etc etc...
But as i said, im no video marketer - so im sure there's a lot more to this game than these few things

When doing social bookmarking I would copy a whole bunch in, but then leave it at the default to only bookmark 2 of the URL's at any given site
The number of links to stay under the radar is always a concern. When I started a new site I had 1,000 links the first month and did not see any penalties. I would how ever stay under this number per month.
When I do anchor text, I try to use my exact key phrase 50% of the time in links. I also use my home page url 50% of time in the links also. But my exact key phrase is not always pointed to the home page. I mix it up with my other interior pages. The other 50% links and anchor text is mixed up with all my interior pages and similar key phrases I can rank for.
This is just what I do, it doesn't mean it's the exact method to follow.
How the strategy is working now with the new panda update, hitting over seo-ed websites?
Taking into account you use the same keyword for every cycle

So far the new panda updates have not really affected me - and we still submitting content to about 10 blog networks. I believe that because each cycle consists of such a wide variety of links, google does not pick up on the fact that blog networks are used - and if they do then they do not really seem to care! Not ALL the links to the site come from one particular blog network. If I build links exclusively using the blog networks im pretty sure I will get the boot by Google
As mentioned above, I think the thing that most matters is the diversity and quality of the links. And I really think that moving forward we are going to need to start paying more attention to our anchor texts and spending more money making it "look natural" ("click here", "read this" etc etc)
Another thing I think is inevitable in the future - is that Google is going to tighten up even more on what it considers a natural link profile for your site - anchor text as well as link types
So if your site is in the health niche for example - I believe google will know and see the link profile of all the sites currently in that niche - it might have averages. e.g. 10% Forum links 45% content links and say 45% bookmarks.
Then if you go and build a site and build say 80% forum links and 20% social network links for example, google will see that your site does not conform to the "normal" link profile of your niche and simply not rank you.
Same goes for anchor texts...
I do believe they do this already, but I think it is going to become the only way to do SEO in the future. Each time you build a site, you will first need to survey what is considered a "normal" link profile for the niche, and then build links accordingly making sure your site conforms to the same "norm"

Thanks for the update. Definitely agree with what you said in bold. Diversifying your anchor text seems to be becoming a LOT more important.
Please send me the same answers you sent to Duc, please. I have been purchasing a LOT of services for the last 3 weeks. I was glad to find your post. Very USEFUL to me. It is time for me to learn this stuff. I noticed that the WSO's I have aren't even half as intense as your SEO method. Definitely going to push my first "Thanks".
I provided all the outsourcing tips on page 2 of this thread. And thanks for the "thanks"

Yeah so far so good...as time progresses we might need to change things around to stay ahead of google, but for now all is going good...
You've GOT to be detailed oriented to succeed in IM. The downside of that is the amount of spreadsheets and text files I have cluttering my computer & the cloud.
That's right. I agree. I've been trying to find people who can be specific in their SEO strategies and system. Whenever I go on oDesk and talk to people who do SEO, I always ask for their strategy. Most give very general details. I told them no way I'm going to hire them if they don't give me specific details because if I don't know what on earth they are doing, I'm not going to hire them. Most just ask for the website and keyword and expect the person to trust them with the SEO work. They give some very general information and that's it.
I think it's important to know exactly what is going on because the detail is important. I know some people just don't have an inclination to attention to details. So thanks to nick for sharing his detailed plan.
Thanks for sharing. A question. Not sure if this has been asked before. But what are the reasons for the MANUAL Web 2.0 campaign? Emphasis being MANUAL, since you later do a SENUKE Web 2.0 campaign. Thanks.
The only reason for the manual web2.0s is so that you can embed the video and possibly a pic. Thats it. As a matter of fact, with the latest updates of SenukeX we have been using only senuke - because you still get at least 20 to 30 web2.0's and its easy to embed the video and pic with html in your content. And the video and pic are always successfully embedded in about half of the web2.0's - which is great because its exactly what we want - some web2.0's with pics and a video and some without...

I feel your pain! You should see the amount of folders, spreadsheets and txt documents I have one within another all in an attempt to keep things organized!!

I agree - no point in hiring someone if you dont know EXACTLY what they are going to be doing. You never know if they are going to do more harm than good if you leave it to them on their own...
One thing that stands out is the effort you put in to "templating" your strategies. If more people were as diligent as you in tracking their activity I bet we'd have a lot less noise on this forum.
Thanks again,
J
Yeah in my opinion tracking your work is the only way to stay on top of what you doing - Every cycle I run is entered an excel document where i track it's progress. Also a great way to know what still needs to be done, and aids in planning...
I would not know any other way to do it to be honest...

To be honest, if you put your own team together - then obviously it will work you out cheaper to do your own cycles. (That's why i can make a profit).
But to make it worth your while, you will need to do at LEAST 10 cycles+ per week - no point paying a salary to an entire team if you are only doing 2 cycles a week!

Finished the web 2.0s, social bookmarking, pinging and now at the AMR stage.
For the AMR blast, are you skipping sites that require captcha?
I just imported a huge list of 200k urls (took 2 feckin days!) and 60k of those were a success.. maybe a little too much now I am thinking.
Also for a new site, would you recommend drip feeding it or just submit now using the same article?
The only backlinks I have to my site are the ones through this cycle (I've been using this and cash202 cycle combined to get the best of both).

WOW
Yeah id say 60k is a little much! How many live links do you actually get from that? I normally get about 200 live links - and submit to all of them at once. But if you doing 60k you might want to drip feed that over a few weeks!
Yeah id say 60k is a little much! How many live links do you actually get from that? I normally get about 200 live links - and submit to all of them at once. But if you doing 60k you might want to drip feed that over a few weeks!
Haha well, I am actually signing up to them all now and a lot of them are failing... doh..
Haha well, I am actually signing up to them all now and a lot of them are failing... doh..
I guess I'll end up with about 15k-20k by the end!
AHHH - so you have not yet submitted the article...that makes much more sense. If your entire article directory contains 60k directories, and you still end up with accounts at 15k to 20k its still a lot.
The big question is how many live links are you going to get at the end. As I said, I normally end up with about 150 to 200 live links - which is good in my opinion. And if you end up with more, you might really want to consider drip feeding the links - or submitting to less directories.
You must remember the idea is to keep a diverse link profile. You don't want too many of any one link type.
Tip: Once you have submitted the article, in the future when you want to create new accounts - just select the directories where the article was successfully posted to. No point in trying to create accounts on all 60k directories again when you know most of them are going to fail
Right now out of the 60k list only 6-7k have been successfully signed up to.. crazy!
But my site is new so it's probably for the best and I'll probably submit to 1000 of them a day and hope 10% of them work.
Would you advise doing a new AMR account for each 1000 blast or just do the full thing on the one account for same article?

Well if you are submitting to new article directories each time - just use the same account. Coz you would have created accounts at all 6-7k - so i assume you will select 1k of those and submit. And then the next day select the next 1k and submit??
So obviously each time you are posting you are using the account for the first time at that particular directory.
But even if you weren't - I use the same account and submit about 10 different articles. Only then do I create a new set of accounts...
robofx, if you already have a video, image, and text. It would be best to add more text to the bottom of your page and update it at least once a week. You could put a new 500+ word article pertaining to your niche there once per week. I do something similar with blog sites, I put my 'sales' post in sticky status so it is always on the top of the home page. Then when ever I add a new post with fresh content it goes below that. This shows search engines that I have fresh content on a weekly basis.

Pretty good idea. But I'd be worried about losing my rankings by constantly modifying the content / keywords on my homepage. I generally keep my content static once it has been ranked and simply add new articles from time to time to show that the site it still being updated.
What exactly would I do to that page, without screwing up its conversion rate properties?

What dollar_bill said is generally what i do. Just make sure the new content is highly related to your niche and includes your main keyword as well as LSI's and you should be ok not to damage your rankings.
If you REALLY do NOT want to add additional content to your sales page, then simply add "article pages" to your site...
mysite.com/article1
mysite.com/article2
etc...
Make sure that the new pages you add all link back to your main money page. And remember to keep updating your sitemap.
This will also help a lot, because Google will still see that the site as a whole keeps getting updated...
Curious how this method is working now after the recent algo changes at G. I've just started implementing it on a few sites but haven't noticed significant movement (still inside of 2 weeks so verdict is withheld).
Anyone have some rankings to share for before/after yesterday's algo updates?
Did anyone see any problem with the latest google algo change? Or things are still fine by you guys end. Just wondering if this strategy is still as good.

Guys I've been keeping a close eye the latest Google updates, and so far my own sites seem to be doing ok - here and there I have had a few pages lose rankings but over all things are still going good.
I cannot speak for others using these cycles though - anyone care to share their experience would be fantastic. I can however say, that I randomly checked a few of my client's sites for which I offer the cycles as a service, and there are plenty of mixed results at the moment. Overall things are still looking good, but there are certainly a few pages that seem to have lost ground in the SERPS - but then again there are also a few that seem to be doing even better...
The case study site I did earlier in this thread is still at number 1 for it's main keyword and number 3 or 4 for another more competitive keyword.
Judging from the post by Matt Cutts on the Google blog about the update, they seem to be targeting mostly sites that have irrelevant links (e.g. an article about golfing but random links to make money online sites), as well as links in poorly spun content.
The site I have been working on for a few months is still holding #5, but....another site has just grab the #2 spot. Most of this sites links come from only a few other sites. So very little diversity. Also, a lot of the contextual links are in unrelated articles (recipe articles with gambling links). Not sure what's going on here. I would hope this site drops real soon, or else I'm not sure what to think.

A ton of Google results are upside-down and backwards right now. Give it some time and I'm assuming the #2 site will drop.
yep, that site finally dropped off the map. Now my site is #4. Just have 2 interior pages holding spots 1 and 2. One page has actual pr of 5 and is 5 years old. The other has actual pr of 3 and is 14 years old. The 3rd spot is a youtube video with 650K views and pr of 6. I am starting a 3rd cycle to see if I can beat these 3 sites. Serpattacks scores my key phrase at 76, Extremely Difficult.

Interesting results - I would have thought the site with the unrelated links would have dropped...glad the other site is doing well...
The case study site I did earlier in this thread has now taken a slight knock - The main keyword went from position 1 to position 2. And the more competitive keyword went from position 3 or 4 to position 7...
And this site is only a PR 1 and is a only a few months old - and you guys know the backlinks have come ONLY from these cycles.
I do however have another site that saw decent improvements since the Google update - and this was without any additional backlinks. The site is a PR3 and about 2 and half years old in the "background check" niche. The site was at position 12 for a very long time for a very competitive keyword - and after the update, out of the blue it was bumped up to position 4...
The links to this site are also primarily from "CYCLES" (although its changed a little over time)..
Also it might be worth noting that all my sites have only these cycle-type links and though I may have seen a few pages lose place in the SERPS overall my portfolio of sites are doing BETTER than before the Google update!
I really do think that the fact we have have not been hit too hard by this update is because the links are always within relevant content. I do however think that moving forward we will put even more emphasis on spinning the articles very well, and putting out more "generic" anchor texts (click here, this site, resource etc etc)
If you run this with magic submitter instead of senile you'll be able to automate more of the process. Just a little food for thought.

I would also be very interested to find out what can be automated with MS that can't be done with Senuke? I would imagine that you are referring to the ability of MS to be "tought" to sign up and submit to certain sites??
SenukeX Campaign: I then run an automated web2.0 campaign using SenukeX (“Social Network” Campaign in SenukeX). I use the same Promo article as content, with links in the article body. I DO NOT submit to the same sites I already submitted to manually (Those where the YouTube video was embedded). This normally gives me additional 25 or 26 properties with my article and links.
Do you always use the same accounts for your SENUKE and manually created WEB 2.0? I guess if you're doing a few SEO runs for the same site, you'll use the same web 2.0 accounts right? And when you move on to other sites, you create new web 2.0 accounts (both manually and through SENUKE)? Am I right? So some of these manually and SENUKE created Web 2.0 accounts/sites have very few posts in total right?
(Or do you try to put all the posts to sites in the same niche on the same Web 2.0 accounts?)

Thanks.
Generally, because they are so easy to create, in SenukeX I always create new accounts. Every time I submit content I will do so on new accounts...
For the manual work, I tend to use the same accounts for each niche OR site - depending on how many cycles I do for a particular site. Generally though I never submit more than about 10 articles per account - then move onto new accounts - even if it is in the same niche.
After ranking on top by following these techniques, for how much time You rremain stable on top position.
Or regularly do some maintenance work.
This is like asking: "how long does it take to a rank a keyword"
It all depends on the keyword you target - how much competition does it have, how strong is the competition, do the competing pages get updated frequently, how many new competitors are entering the market...etc etc...
The more difficult the keyword is, the shorter it's stay in the top 10 - unless maintenance work is done (i.e. updated content, new backlinks etc etc...)
Generally though I target easy to medium competition keywords and once I get them to the top 10 they require no further work. Some stay ranked for a long time (I have some pages that have had the same rankings for over 3 years now - right through all the Google changes) And others fall right off the SERPS while others even gain rankings over time...
So if you are planning on targeting difficult keywords, be prepared to keep updating your site and building links. If you are targeting 4 or 5 word long tails you will probably stay ranked for a very long time...
My eyes are bleeding after reading through 8 pages continuously! Just kidding lol, but I actually can't keep my eyes off it. This thread is by far the most helpful one I've read since the first day I joined WF
And the more I read it, the more it pushes me to taking actions. I can't wait to see results on my own after seeing so many success stories from fellow warriors!
But before I finally go implementing it, I just want to ask you a few questions. Hope you don't mind explain them to us all.
As you know, Google is going frenzy these days with Panda, Penguin, Lion, Tiger, etc. updates. And many sites got hit both white hat legitimate and black hat ones. Actually, I've created 6 sites so far and only one of them made its way to the final destination. It used to make me some money before. But after those crazy updates, it got hit badly. That means my little money machine is broken now
What I did with that site was to build links solely from blog networks (ALN and Link Authority to be specific). About 80-90% of my links are from them. And I know it's not a good idea to put almost all my eggs in one (bad?) basket.
That's also the reason why I've been searching for an effective link building method to implement with my future sites. And this "layered" link building appears to work really well.
OK, enough with my stuff. Here are my questions:
- According to your own experience, has your strategy changed after those Google updates especially the Penguin which targeted "over-optimization" sites?
- In your opinion, what are the "over-SEOed" factors to take into consideration? According to my observation, too many exact anchor text links coming from only a few sources might be a problem.
- And if, for example, you could only have access to AMR and 3 free blog networks (say ALN, Article Ranks, Free Traffic System), there is no SeNukeX, no Scrapebox, what would your cycle look like?
Again, thanks a million times Nick for creating this awesome thread, you're my SEO idol

Duy.
I'm glad my thread is helping you take action - be sure to pop back here and post your results for us all to read about!
Regarding your questions:
1. Yes - I am now incorporating a lot more generic words for anchor text (click here, resource, site, this site etc etc...) Also, even though I have not personally seen a huge difference, I am considering submitting to less blog networks and maybe substituting with another link type. From what I've seen Unique Article Wizard still seems to be working good.
2. You exactly right about the over-optimized SEO - personally I have not seen too much of a difference. But many people I have spoken to have taken HUGE knocks in the SERPS.
In my opinion, the reason my own sites have not been hit too bad is because of the quality of the content - we always use hand spun, RELEVANT content. And secondly because of the wide variety of links we build.
As mentioned before, the only thing I want to start concentrating more on is using generic anchor text.
My own observations are pretty much in line with this article from Micro Site Masters - these guys analyzed tons of data to see what affect the Penguin update had on what type of sites - you can read about it here:
3. If I did not have access to Senuke and ScrapeBox, I would either hire someone to do this work for me, or I would sit and manually create ALL the web 2.0's which SenukeX would normally do. But even so, I would still need someone to do the Social Bookmarking and ScrapeBox work...
I read your article again and again， thx very much.
I have a question for the target keyword.
You mean target a keyword one time, is it safe now?
Could you give me some advice for medium niche
site? i dont think i need so much work for a medium-small niche site.
You can you use senuke services from experienced person..
To run senuke experienced person is needed..
i am also offering senuke x service in lowest prices because i get orders in bulk.
Thanks,

Not sure what's going on with this the latest 'animal update'. I hope it's just a new dance going on. My site was holding #5 for a few weeks and now it's gone off the map. I used all original articles for each of my manual submits, then manual bookmarks and rss feeds to link to them. I also outsourced some bookmarks and rss's to these sites. I only used two article directory submits with manual spun content. I post a fresh original article on my blog once per week. I thought for sure I was being really white hat with my backlinks.
I am trying to figure out why a site like this would be in position #9. The home page is just a list of webpages. Most are 404 errors. 2/3's of the backlinks for this site come from the same website and have the same key phrase stuffed anchor text. :confused:

Geez, yeah I've read TONS of stories just like this - just have a look at Matt Cutts post where he announces the Penguin update - TONS of people with similar stories. It sounds like the one guys even runs some large charity, and has been ranking for certain keywords for YEARS - and now google places similar crap as above in place of his site!
And from what you say, the way you run your site is the IDEAL way for SEO - and in fact its pretty much what I recommend to everyone - and now even the "good sites" are taking a knock!
JSprojects is correct, Google is all over the place with the rankings. Even with many of my clients, today they top 5 and tomorrow they not even in the top 100, only to be on page 3 the day after - all after years of steady rankings!
I'm sure things will settle down...What does your rankings look like today, still the same thing?
In my opinion, the reason my own sites have not been hit too bad is because of the quality of the content - we always use hand spun, RELEVANT content
I'm assuming your quality content means that your spun article is done well - free of grammar mistakes and not automatically spun as you mentioned. You said 60% uniqueness. Is that good enough? Also, you seem to hint in the OP that you only spin words. You don't do sentences/paragraphs? Do you take extra precaution in terms of varying html (italics, bold, heading, alignment, etc.) when submitting your blasts (and even when manually submitting)?
3) What do you mean by relevant content? Just that the content is relevant to your site and not like an article on health with a link to a car website right? Anything else?
4) Do you think it's still good to use Scrapebox blasting after all that's happened - even if it's not directly to your money site?

1) Currently testing UAW - if the results are good i might come back and do another case study for you guys
2) Yes you are correct thats exactly what i mean. All the content I use is MANUALLY spun and each new spin is totally free from grammar and spelling errors.
60% uniquess has worked well for me so far, but ill be honest sometimes we dont even go as high as 60% unique if it's going to affect the quality of the spun articles. I'd rather have QUALITY over UNIQUENESS
And yeah mostly we only spin at word / phrase level. Here and there we might do entire sentences, but generally we don't.
The only extra precautions I take is making sure the article is neatly spaced out into paragraphs and that there are NO italics, bolds etc... (Like what can sometimes get left behind after spinning)
3) That's exactly what I mean by relevant. But it can be pretty broad too though - example, your site is about being 19 weeks pregnant. I would place that link in any article about being pregnant (generally) - the article being used for submitting does not have to be specifically about being 19 weeks pregnant..
4) So far yes I do. The idea is just to get SOME link juice to the properties. Of course if you could afford a more diverse link structure to each property then that's even better!

4) Do you think it's still good to use Scrapebox blasting after all that's happened - even if it's not directly to your money site?
I see a lot of fiver gigs asking for 1-3 articles (not in spintax format).
Does UAW not accept spun content, and won't this mean the the 1-3 articles being submitted will just be duplicated 100's of times across all the sites UAW will submit too? (and are both your anchor links targeting your money site when submitting with these directory sites, or a mix of Tier1?)
I suddenly remembered you mentioned you before that you build the "cycle" every time you have some content updated (if I remember it right as I can't find the exact post, it might be buried deep down in this thread). Can you explain more about this for me?
Let say, I initially built one cycle and my main keyword was pushed to number 7 on page 1. And now I want to build another cycle, what should I do? Create another page of content, get that new piece of content indexed and start building another cycle? Or updating the old content (add 150-200 words to the end of the old article) is enough?
Also, have you tried to rank a "stable" website with your cycles before? I mean you publish all of your content at once, then start backlinking them with your cycles without the need of indexing those content first? I want to ask that because I've heard some people say that it's natural to Google to see a site having fresh content updated then links start to roll in (can be in higher volume than normal). What do you think about it?

Thanks a lot buddy
If I am targeting a fairly difficult keyword, then yes I first update the content (on the same page i am targeting) and then roll out a cycle for it. If after 1 cycle the keyword is at number 7 and I wanted to get it even better, id add more content (to the end of the article) and then roll out another cycle. But I would probably add some additional pieces of content to the same page while busy with the cycle as well...
I also go about it the other way as well - adding brand new content pages to the site and then building links to them. This work particularly well if the main target keyword of the site (homepage keyword) id very difficult and I have not seen positive movement in some time. Then while adding new pages and building links to them, I also target the homepage and build links to it as well in each cycle.
This way the home page has got as many links to it as all the pages put together...so it looks more natural. This strategy does take longer to start working though, because you will only see movement on your main (homepage) keyword after Google starts seeing your entire site as an authority in the niche that is continually being updated...
Regarding "stable" websites - I have and generally the results are also good - especially e-commerce sites for some reason...(with the little content they usually display)
But generally if the site is "stable" and nothing has changed for a while, then it might be better to add some content to it before running a cycle - this gets it moving forward VERY quickly. And to be honest, older sites tend to be more stable in their rankings after all the linkbuilding (even the new pages)
#1: For the 12 Web 2.0 web site accounts, when we submit our unique article to each one, we only are linking to YouTube video? Not home site correct? (Giving some link juice to 2nd tier YouTube link)
No, that's incorrect. You do link to your money site, but you embed the YouTube video into each article. The video is to make the content more "valuable" in Google's eyes, but it will also start receiving views meaning some of them will start getting more views in YT instelf - and since the video is marketing your site too (via a watermark and link in the description) you get even more exposure for your website

The "promo article" should already be in spintax form - this you would do first. So each time you want to use the article you will have to create a "new spin" and use that. But most of the blog networks allow you to submit the article just like that in spintax, and so does Senuke for the social Network campaign

If you create the accounts properly, and your content is spun well then most will not delete your account. But if I had to say, I would say Tumblr is probably the most likely to delete your account. Posterous and Squidoo also sometimes delete accounts easily though...

Hi Nick. Great informative post. Its probably some of the best "FREE" info I've read that could have even been a great wso. Love how you laid it all out step by step. I have a question tho regarding what you said about using blog networks-

I read that google is going after all the blog networks and de-indexing sites using them, is that the case and is this still a good relevant strategy to use?
Hi Nick. I've been following your thread and have it bookmarked in fact. You provided some very valuable info here. I haven't seen... How is your method working post Penguin?

Nick?
I have seen a few pages here and there slip in rankings, but overall my rankings for my entire portfolio of websites is actually doing slightly BETTER after the the penguin update.
As many of you already know, I was offering these cycles as a service and this gave me the luxury of seeing what the cycle's are doing to my client's sites as well after the penguin update - and unfortunately many of them have not seen the same positive results I have seen. Many of my clients have had their sites drop drastically, and many others have seen a drastic increase. I have not seen any clear pattern (I probably will if i look deeper though). So at this point my conclusion is that the cycles definitely still work - but you going to need to put in extra effort by varying the anchor text, updating your site often and using GOOD QUALITY, RELEVANT content when doing cycles.

No problem, glad you find it useful...As for the blog networks, I stopped using them altogether and replaced them with Unique Article Wizard - So far so good; I have only done cycles for 7 pages so far with this technique, and so far the results are pretty much what I'd expect from the cycles using all the blog networks as before. So at the moment, UAW seems to be a pretty decent replacement.
For those of you that do not want to use Blog networks at all, that is fine, just find something to replace it with. The idea is just to keep your links diverse.
The Warrior forum seems broken you can't post a new thread so I thought I'd say it here. It's about Ezine Articles! Is it worth using there service for back links.
I've published plenty of articles with them but today one got rejected and the reviewer said stuff along the lines of my link site should not have exit pop ups, should be relevant, should not have excessive ads.
I can't believe it, for starters I hate popups and have none, never have done never will, my content is not only unique but both relevant talking about the same topic and provides real value to whoever reads it as it helps people who have been treated badly. And all my sites have the same ad layout which have been previously approved no problems.
Nothing more annoying then lack of consistency in approvals. Just wondering how other peoples experience with them has been. They take a while to approve your article as well. Do you recommend using them or using different article directories?
No problem - be sure to come back and post your results for us all to read about!

No problem, glad you found it useful. On page 2 of this thread I give plenty of tips on outsourcing. I am also releasing a WSO soon on outsourcing the entire process easily and cheaply - it will include the details of all the freelancers and sellers I personally use and have set up agreements with to complete these cycles...So keep an eye out for that!

Personally I think EZA links are very good - but not on their own. When you use them in a larger strategy and they are being used to help diversify
your site's link structure, they can be very powerful. The only question is, are you willing to put in the effort for those links?
Your experience is the EXACT reason I don't really use them anymore. I used to rely heavily on them for backlinks, but they are just too inconsistent when deciding on what is allowed and what is not...
I just want to ask a quick question about indexing your Web 2.0 properties. Have you found it hard recently to index your Web 2.0 sites (pages)? I've created about 15 Web 2.0 properties the last 3 days and built a lot of links from blog networks to them (I don't have access to BMR and Scrapebox so I have to utilize my blog network subscriptions).
I've searched Google for the unique phrase I used to track those submitted articles and found out that about 100 indexed results. That means Google still indexes the articles from blog networks pretty well. And that also means they saw the links that point to my Web 2.0 sites as well. I also do some manual and automated Social bookmarking submissions with IMAutomator with links pointing to my Web 2.0
But the result I've got so far is not that great. Only 5 out of 15 are indexed. Not long ago I find it pretty easy to index anything in Google. Just build some links from Social bookmarking sites and a few links from article submissions of blog networks could do the trick. But it's getting harder these days especially after the updates.
Have you experienced the same thing? Also, do you have any suggestions for me?

To be honest, we run so many cycles for various sites and projects I have not recently checked how many are actually getting indexed. Generally though, most get indexed...as we run a ScrapeBox campaign on them as well as add their links in an RSS feed, which then get's pinged, and submitted to a few RSS directories...
This has to be one of the best posts I have read here. It takes a disciplined and serious IM to follow this path. Nobody said making money was simple, but it can be easy when the right blueprint is provided.
Interesting thread, but after asking other experts, the OP methods are no longer relevant after major Panda and Penguin updates.
Perhaps I skipped too much from middle of thread that gave an update ?
Well everyone is entitled to their opinion i suppose - it still works for me.
Their however been a few slight changes, I no longer use all the blog networks mentioned, I only submit to UAW. Also, instead of creating a PDF and a Slide Show I create only 2 slide shows - and submit 1 to Scribd and the other to Slide Share - this ensures the links stay live. One other thing that has changed is I use a lot more generic anchor text - as apposed to just using the keyword as before.
Another thing that I have mentioned over and over again is this: The reason I think it is still working for me is the fact that we use GOOD QUALITY content (No auto spun junk), and create a diverse structure of links - without using spammy blog comments and profile links...
Also, embedding the video and a pic in some of the web 2.0's also provides that extra quality component..
This is just my 2 cents - SEO is not a science, and everyone should just be doing what works for them...

Could you clarify this? Are these 2 slide shows the same or different? A unique version from a well spun spintax?
Also, why does this ensure the links stay live? Thanks
The two slide shows are different - from the article that should be in spintax, simply create 2 new spins from it. Then use those two articles to create 2 slide shows.
I usually create a Title page, with the heading of the title, and the the website name that I am promoting along with a pic. Then subsequent slides simply have 1 or 2 paragraphs with relevant pics next to each. Your links are placed in the content.
I don't don't know why this makes sure the links stay live - but what I do know is that if the source document is a PDF and it is submitted to Scribd, a lot of the time the links will not be clickable. But when the source file is a Power Point slide show, the links are always clickable...
Thanks for the update. I wasn't in doubt whether it works for you, I just know there had to be tweaks since the OP, and after Panda.....
No problem...just make sure you use good quality content and diverse anchor texts and things should work...

No problem guys. I would strongly advise against MNS though - once you find a winner, add more pages to the sites. In my opinion MNS is fast losing it's effectiveness - especially with all the latest google updates

So far for me it's still working pretty good - I have made a few tweaks though (read above) - Just make sure you use good quality content, and diverse anchor texts and everything should work ok
It's still successful with a few small tweaks. Mainly focusing on quality over pure quantity.
This is exactly right - and also using a lot more generic anchor texts. I read a report about having only about 20% of your links use your keyword as the anchor text - the other 80% should just be generic "click here" type of links. And this information was based on TONS of data...
Don't you think it is much more better to use various keywords or lsi keywords than using "click here" anchors?

Don't you think it is much more better to use various keywords or lsi keywords than using "click here" anchors?
No. I don't think using LSI keywords will do any harm, and as a matter of fact I DO use LSI's in the mix - BUT you must remember, in reality when sites are linking to your site (naturally), they will most likely use words such as "click here" "this resource" "this site" "yoursite.com" "www.yoursite.com"
1. Firstly, create a YouTube account and submit the Video to YouTube. Remember to start the video description with the full page URL of the target page you are trying to rank for. Ex. http://www.yoursite.com/target_page.html
2. Create accounts on Scribd and SlideShare. Submit the PDF file to Scribd. Then submit the Power Point Slide Show to Slide Share
Nick would you still recommend submitting to the blog networks?
It's the only step I haven't done (along with scrapebox comments) but I have been seeing good results so far, although I have a feeling some high pr blog networks might push it further up but it might also be a bad idea now with google shutting down these networks slowly but surely?
When you create these accounts do you do them all manually or do you use a specific automated software? Should they be created using different proxies?
The You Tube, Scribd and Slide Share accounts are created manually. Each SET of accounts will use a unique proxy. So you will end up using only 1 proxy for one cycle. When you move onto the next cycle, you will use a new proxy to create the new accounts
As for the web2.0's - we used to do them manually, but the guy that does it for us now uses his own software.

Guys I mentioned this a little further up in the thread; I no longer submit to all the blog networks. At the moment I am using only Unique Article Wizard and seeing good results. When the blog networks got hit so hard by Google, UAW did not lose all their sites. And now they stopped providing the URL's in their report so it makes it much harder for Google to mass-index their network.
They are also constantly adding new sites to their network. Now im not saying they do not get sites de-indexed, but i really do think that they will not easily get ALL their site's de-indexed.
I have HEARD that it's pretty much the same story with Article Marketing Automation, Article Ranks and My Article Network. I have yet to test these though...
Each SET of accounts will use a unique proxy. So you will end up using only 1 proxy for one cycle. When you move onto the next cycle, you will use a new proxy to create the new accounts
As for the web2.0's - we used to do them manually, but the guy that does it for us now uses his own software.
Nick,
1) What software does he use? So you get him to set up the accounts and also post them? Do you get him also to fill in the profiles to make it seem real?
2) I'm not sure if I've asked this to you before but for each web 2.0 account, do you just post one article or many articles? If many, are they are linking to the same money site, or various money site but all in the same niche?
3) When you say each set of accounts using one proxy, are you talking about for all your accounts - the VA also follows this? And using one proxy for creation and posting right?
4) When you say "So you will end up using only 1 proxy for one cycle. When you move onto the next cycle, you will use a new proxy to create the new accounts", that means you don't put more than one article/document in each document sharing or youtube or web 2.0? That means one account per cycle - that means each web 2.0 account only has one article? The second cycle (pointing to the same money site) will use a totally new one? Am I right?
1) What software does he use? So you get him to set up the accounts and also post them? Do you get him also to fill in the profiles to make it seem real?
He uses his own private bot - but you could essentially get the same thing done with SenukeX if you use html to embed the video.
OR you could get uBot studio and create your own bot...

Normally I use 1 account for each MONEY SITE. So that means each account will have multiple articles submitted - but then I never post more than 5 to 10 articles per account anyway, even if its for the same site.
But nowdays, since it's all created with software it's easy to do so I use new accounts each time for the web 2.0's. But the Scribd, SlideShare and YouTube accounts will get used multiple times (never more than 10 though)

Yes that's exactly what I mean. I will use PROXY1 and create ALL the accounts using the same proxy - and post to these account with this proxy. If it's for the same site and im doing multiple cycles, I might post multiple times to these accounts - always using PROXY1
Then when starting a new cycle, or a cycles for a new site I will clear my cache and delete cookies etc and change to PROXY2 - then create the new set of accounts and post...

Thanks Nick. Not sure what you mean. Just to clarify. This means that say jondoe.wordpress.com may be used for keyword.com site. And you post 5-10 articles there with each article linking back to keyword.com (moneysite).
If this is correct, wouldn't this be a bit fishy with all posts in that Web 2.0 pointing back to one moneysite alone - or you think it's OK?
I see a lot of fiver gigs asking for 1-3 articles (not in spintax format).
Does UAW not accept spun content, and won't this mean the the 1-3 articles being submitted will just be duplicated 100's of times across all the sites UAW will submit too? (and are both your anchor links targeting your money site when submitting with these directory sites, or a mix of Tier1?)
Thanks again
They do accept spintax articles, but they also have a wizard that helps you spin each paragraph 3 times...this is probably what the guys on fiverr are doing...

No, it means Jon Doe would have an account at wordpress.com - but he would have multiple blogs on his accounts, and each blog would have an article linking back to your money site:
article1.wordpress.com
article2.wordpress.com etc etc..
But again, some of the sites you are unable to do this with and you will need a totally separate account for a new "site" or "page" or "blog" or whatever...
Either way buddy, you are reading WWWAAYYY TOOO MUCH into how you should use your accounts. It's not going to effect your rankings - it's simple, the more you use one account the more at risk you are of losing many more links...simple.
If you are willing to take more risk, create less accounts and use them more often. If you do not want to take a large risk, create more accounts...
Nick, your method is what i had planned and reading your post, i just saved a lot of testing time. I must say you have been generous in sharing what you know. I definitely learn quick a bit from your experience. Glad to know that this work for penguin too. lol...
You still recommending Animoto for your videos? It looks like for the $30 annual price they add their watermark. Do you still add your watermark?
Also what software do you use for using different proxies to submit to web 2.0's,etc ?
I use the $37 Plus account, and they only add their logo to the end of the video. Many times I just leave it as it is, or I use camtasia and remove it manually. But if you really can't be bothered removing it, and you really don't want it there you will have to get their pro account.
Normally my videos will start and end with a Text module mentioning the website name and URL. Sometimes I do watermark the video URL at the bottom of the video though - again, i use camtasia for this
Regarding the proxies, because we only use one proxy for one cycle - all the accounts across the various sites will be created under the same proxy. So we don't really change proxies all that often, and we tend to simply manually change the proxy in the internet options of the browser.
But if you are changing proxies fairly often, and would like some software to make it easier, you can use foxyproxy - it's a firefox addon and works great to help manage your proxies

No problem, be sure to pop back and post some results! As for penguin, just make sure you use quality content and varied anchor text...
Nick, just wanted to thank you for your excellent post. I started on my first cycle last week, and already see some good results on the keyword I used. It ranked from nowhere to 14th at the moment when I have only completed step 1(social bookmark for web2.0 properties) and 2 (social bookmark for AMR links). I am very happy with the result.
Also, I have a question regarding to SENUKE social bookmarking. I have noticed that the list on social bookmarking on SenukeX only contains 42 sites. So besides social bookmarking on Senuke, do you also use Social Bookmark Demon to make more bookmarkings? Is 42 bookmarkings considered enough for 1 cycle? Same question for the RSS submission on Senuke. The RSS list on Senuke is even shorter than Social bookmarkings.
This is the one of the most valuable posts I have even read about SEO. Thank you for your sharing!

No problem, im glad you found it useful. Lately we have actually started using other means for social bookmarking...and I see no reason BMD won't work fine. Just be sure to bookmark to quality sites. Don't scrape some crappy pligg-type list that's full of PR0 bookmarking sites...As a matter of fact, all our social bookmarks are PR2 and above!
The RSS feeds are purely to help get the backlinks indexed so that Google knows they are there. Same goes for the ScrapeBox campaign - except this also gives a little extra link juice.
So personally I feel the RSS directories in Senuke are more than enough - lately I have only been submitting manually to Feedage.com and also seeing pretty decent results. We are also currently testing nuclear link indexer to help get the link indexed - looks pretty good so far.
Congrats on the positive results so far! Be sure to keep us posted...

Some interesting reading there guys thanks everyone for all their input as usual.
Has anyone had any negative effects as a result of this method since the recent Panda updates? I like to keep everything as white hat as possible but I'm tempted to give this a whirl. I definitely won't be using one keyword anchor though. That's suicide these days.
You can now make use of the EXACT SAME freelancers I personally use to complete these cycles. They are already trained for the tasks, and I already have pre-existing agreements set up with them - which you can take opportunity of as well!
Thanks for your guide. For social bookmarking, did you bookmark all urls like web 2 and AMR, or just your money site to high PR sites? Does it matter if I want to bookmark other URLs at all in the eyes of google? Thanks for your reply.
Thanks for your guide. For social bookmarking, did you bookmark all urls like web 2 and AMR, or just your money site to high PR sites? Does it matter if I want to bookmark other URLs at all in the eyes of google? Thanks for your reply.
I used to run a random Social Bookmarking campaign to all the URL's - the idea was just to get at least a few of them with a couple of SB links. But now days I simply run a high PR SB campaign to my money site only. I only use ScrapeBox for all the other links...
If however you do bookmark other URLS as well, it will give those properties a little more "authority" in google's eyes, meaning if your link is on that page it will mean a little more for your rankings. (This is the theory of it anyways)
nick, I can't pm you because of my low post counts, but I have a question about the outsource guide I bought. Can you pm me via iquangtt at gmail.com? Thank you.
Sent you an email buddy...

Streamline is absolutely correct. This strategy still works well for us, but you need to make sure you use QUALITY, relevant content and also vary your anchor text to include general anchor texts like "click here" "this site" etc etc... As a matter of fact, I think read something about using your keyword as anchor text only about 25% of the time - which is what we do and its working well so far...
Anchor text diversity. If people are going to take note of that and not force the same keyword on all of the pages where they'll build their links, that's going to look unnatural. I would have to agree that you should use the general anchor texts, because we can consider those as strong calls to action, depending on how you've delivered those statements.
Great post thanks for the valuable information provided by you.
I just love the backliking tips that you have mentioned,and yu have really explained great things to rank high in google SERP.
No problem..

Yeah, especially after the Penguin updates - anchor text diversity as well as RELEVANT content are vitally important now...

Definitely. Diversity is really, really important now. Though I still lean towards having a higher # of anchor text backlinks. (55/45) No issues yet.
Is it possible to do two cycle for the same keyword? I want to target the same keyword and increase # of backlinks to it, but I am not sure how. Do I write a new unique article using the same keyword? or Do I add more content to the old article and do another cycle? I am concerned if google will penalize the site if I backlink the same keyword with no new content. Thanks!!
Awesome thread, I'm definitely using the strategies here and making sure my anchor text is very, very diversified.
Question, though. I purchased the WSO, but it simply says to hire a guy to create accounts for the 40 web 2.0's. However, I want to do this on my own for a while, until I learn the system very well. After that, I'll outsource, but for now I want to know exactly how to do it myself.
So, what are the top 40 web 2.0 sites we should be posting our spun articles to?
Question: When you add two links in the promo article, do you manually add these links to each spun article? OR do you add these links in a syntax format (just like when you are adding a syntax to each word)?
Let me ask you this, so we can put it on the record, do you think you can see results if you skip step 5 and 6 the senukex and amr part?
Also all the other automation? If I were to strengthen the links with social bookmarking and lets say blog commenting all manually, and I am in a low-med competition, would there still be results? Or is it a waste of time?
Thank you for your post. I appreciate that this post is relatively new, however IM moves very quickly and I was wondering if you have made any further discoveries and/or changes as to how you would do things in addition to/instead of what is already written below.
Thanks!

Hi guys,
I've seen a lot of talk about SEO and link building strategies lately, and thought I'd chip in and give you guys the EXACT SEO strategy I personally use to rank my own websites.
Using my strategy, you work on only ONE keyword at a time. I work in SEO "cycles" each cycle targets and builds links for that ONE keyword. When the cycle is completed, I target the next keyword in another cycle dedicated to that keyword. The point here is not to target more than one keyword at a time in the same SEO Cycle.
Each cycle takes a considerable amount of time, and although it's possible to do it entirely on your own I HIGHLY recommend you outsource the work. If you attempt to do everything yourself, you will burn yourself out within a few weeks, and will probably want to give up on IM completely!
So as soon as you can afford it, get others to complete this work for you.
(SEE FURTHER ON IN THE THREAD FOR A LIVE CASE STUDY)
This is how I get these results:
STEP 1: Pick a keyword
Pick ONE keyword on your site to target in the SEO cycle. If it's a very difficult keyword, first add a new article to your site. If it's easy to moderate competition, then this is not necessary.
STEP 2: Creating PROMO Content
Here you need to create all the content you will be using in the SEO cycle.
1. Start with an article related to your niche. This article does NOT have to target the keyword you are trying to rank for; it just needs to be about something relating to your niche. Then add spin syntax to the article (The Best spinner or Magic Article Re-writer works good). If you do not have money to buy one of these, I think there is a free version of spinner chief that will do the job.
NOTE: DO NOT automatically spin this article!! You need to manually spin each word so that the article is at least 60% unique. The idea is that when you generate a unique article, that it is the type of quality you would be willing to put on your website or submit to ezine articles (It must be THAT Good!) An article that does not read easy or make proper sense will NOT DO! (Trust me, I have extensively tested this)
Also remember to spin the title well - multiple titles all spun together works best.
Add two links in the article. Normally my one link goes to the page with the target keyword (The keyword is used as anchor text). My other link is normally linked to my home page (where my site's main keyword is used as anchor text). Make sure that each time you spin the article the links are left intact.
2. Generate 2 unique versions of your promo article. Use these 2 articles and create 1 PDF file and 1 Power Point Slide show. Remember to add plenty of pictures.
3. Use Animoto, and create a video based on the article. The video must be at least 1min to 2min long. The easiest way to do this is to read the article, and pick a few facts you want to bring across in the video. Then spread the facts over a few text modules and simply add relevant pictures in between.
Remember to watermark your site URL at the bottom of the video.
You will need at least an Animoto Plus account to create full length videos - I think this only costs about $30 a year now.
STEP 3: Unleash the Promo content to the world!
As you submit your content to the various sites, it would be a good idea to copy each page's URL that you create into a text document. You will be using these URL's later.
1. Firstly, create a YouTube account and submit the Video to YouTube. Remember to start the video description with the full page URL of the target page you are trying to rank for. Ex. http://www.yoursite.com/target_page.html
2. Create accounts on Scribd and SlideShare. Submit the PDF file to Scribd. Then submit the Power Point Slide Show to Slide Share
Then MANUALLY submit UNIQUE versions of your promo article to each one. BUT, embed your YouTube video in each, and include AT LEAST one relevant picture.
Sometimes some of the web2.0's will delete your pages - but it's still well worth the effort trying to submit to them.
This is probably the most boring and time consuming part of the entire SEO cycle. In the beginning I created a bot using UBOT to sign up to all these sites for me. But now days I got people working for me in the Philippines that take care of this.
4. Blog Networks. There are 8 Blog networks that I submit my Promo article to. Some may require you to remove the links from the body, and put them in a resource box instead. My article is submitted to the following networks: Article Blueprint, Distribute Your Articles, Blog Blueprint, Authority Link Network, Article Ranks, Free Traffic system, My Article Network and SEO Extreme.
5. SenukeX Campaign: I then run an automated web2.0 campaign using SenukeX ("Social Network" Campaign in SenukeX). I use the same Promo article as content, with links in the article body. I DO NOT submit to the same sites I already submitted to manually (Those where the YouTube video was embedded). This normally gives me additional 25 or 26 properties with my article and links.
6. Article Marketing Robot campaign. I have over 15k article directories in my AMR, just got the lists for free on the internet and added them as I got them. Out of these I successfully submit to about 1,500 sites and get about 300 to 400 which auto approve my article.
Again, if you are targeting a difficult keyword then it is recommended to write a new article to blast with AMR. But for Medium to easy competition keywords this is not necessary.
Do not include links in your content body for AMR blasts. They need to be in a resource box. I normally include two keywords in my resource box - one to my site (target keyword as anchor text) and the other to a random URL of the manual web2.0 sites, including the Docstoc, SlideShare, Scribd and YouTube URL's or an inner page of your site. This can all be randomized using spin syntax.
STEP 4: Strengthen your links!
This part is often overlooked by so many marketers, yet it is absolutely essential to getting results. Do not quit your SEO cycle half way through; else you will be greatly disappointed with your results.
1. Thorough Social Bookmarking campaign. Use SenukeX or Book Marking Demon and social bookmark the following URL's to all the Social Bookmarking sites:
a. All Manually Created Web2.0 pages
b. YouTube Video URL
c. SlideShare, Docstoc and Scribd pages
2. Quick Social Bookmarking campaign. Again use SenukeX or Book Marking Demon and bookmark the AMR links. This does not have to be thorough. The idea is simply to bookmark each AMR URL on at least three social bookmarking sites.
NOTE: Each feed should only contain about 50 URLS. You should have about 4 or 5 RSS feeds after all the URL's are added into feeds.
Then use SenukeX and submit these RSS feeds to all the RSS aggregators. And use the Pinger module in SenukeX to Ping all the RSS feeds as well.
4. ScrapeBox Blast. Use scrapebox and blast the following urls:
a. All Manually created web2.0 pages
b. All SenukeX created web2.0 pages
c. All AMR created pages
d. Money Site (Only if it is well aged)
I have simply searched the internet for free auto-approve lists. I normally blast to about 60K to 100k blogs.
And there you have it! That marks the end of one SEO cycle, and it means you should get started with the next!
Regarding Accounts, I only ever create new accounts when I start working on a new site. Some sites have 10+ SEO cycles done on them already, and the same set of accounts was used! I always use proxies, sometimes private, paid proxies and other times just free scraped proxies from scrapebox.
I have NEVER EVER had ANY kind of penalty using this strategy. All the sites I received good page one rankings for have stayed there for months and months with no additional work from me.
Feel free to adjust this strategy to your own needs.
Once you have done this a couple of times, one person should be able to complete 2 to 3 of these cycles a week. Each of my assistants in the Philippines can complete 2 cycles a week, and get started on the third!
It's a TON of work for one person, but if you are willing to put in the work you will definitely see great results. I hope this strategy will be useful to at least some of you.
Remember, if you like the post don't forget to hit THANKS!
Regards
Nick
!! GREAT NEWS !!
After countless PM's basically begging me for an outsourcing solution - I have finally caved!
You can now make use of the EXACT SAME freelancers I personally use to complete these cycles. They are already trained for the tasks, and I already have pre-existing agreements set up with them - which you can take opportunity of as well!
Just thought I would post an update on what's done so far. Testing this on a site that is 2 years old and for a keyword which I reckon is medium to Hard difficulty.
Completed all steps exactly as you have mentioned and my keyword has jumped from position 15 to position 6 on the first page! This is quite a surprise for me for the site to move up so quickly and this was within 4 days of completing the first cycle. I could have completed this cycle in 2 days or even 1 but been so busy with building out a clients site I thought it would be interesting to see what results I could get. What's even more surprising is that I hadn't even completed the scrapebox part as I wasn't sure as to how to blast the URLS.
For example, I have a 200K auto approve list, do I do one submission to each URL mentioned with the full list or do I share all the URLS with the 200k list?
I think I would get even greater results had I completed this step, I am going to move on to another keyword and see what happens with that. Impressed so far.
P.S Forgive my grammer, I am sending this out from my iphone and I still can't get used to this on screen keyboard crap :-)
Great strategy, but I don't understand how to vary the anchor text post-penguin. I mean, if we are doing a blast about "spanish hotels", what percentage of the anchor text should actually have "spanish hotels" in it? 10% 20% 30% 100%?
If we only do say 20% and fill it up with LSI and related keywords like "spanish weather, spanish accommodations, spanish travel, click here for the guide, etc" isn't this over-diluted and not effective for a competitive keyword like "spanish hotels"?
I don't know. I doubt if anyone really does. I read somewhere that about 25% of overall links should have the targret anchor with the rest made up of natural looking anchors like "click here", "www.yourdomain.com", "Company Name" and LSI keywords. Like I say, this could well be a load of bollox but it makes sense to me. If your link profile is made up entirely of exact match anchors my granny could tell you that those links aren't natural.
Okay, I am writing this to hopefully get some help on my quest to rank my sites. I am very new to the world of IM and have been lurker for sometime now, typical story. I recently decided 2 months ago to really put in 120% effort into the world of IM to help supplement my income.
My questions are these:
1) I have recently bought AMR myself, but I am confused on the setup. Do I put my money website address in the field that says website? or do I put my money website in the author's "About me" section? or Do I put in the websites of my web 2.0 and blogs sites that in turn point to my money site?!
Now, I know this may sound trivial to some, but this is my first time dealing with this program and this small snag has resulted in me being a bit worried in terms of moving forward with a backlinking strategy.
There is no diversification in the keyword used. There's no way this will work now. Completely violates what is set out in recent updates. I've never seen anything other than negative results from spinning articles.
just my $0.02 but it seems like every google algo change is based on penalizing sites that are not providing something relatively valuable to the end user. This strategy provides a badly worded article (that probably cant even be read anymore its gone through so many spins) to thousands of users with a big fat link to the site/person who "wrote" said horrible article.
use that strategy and you'll never have to worry about google....try and manipulate it, speed it up, cheat the system....you're going to have problems. Its very simple.
But the thing is, we're in it for the money. If you can build 20 sites in a day, and then spend 2 days, and $50 worth of server time to post crap on the internet, and then you make money... then doing everything "nice" like you say isn't very appealing.
Yeah sites get slapped, but if they cost $30 and one hour of your time, who cares? It's about ROI.
If people don't want to buy stuff from your spammy site then they won't. You're not forcing them too. Plus, just because your SEO is spammy, doesn't mean you don't have a legit business, or a decent offer.
And if you think we shouldn't force ourselves onto google to get free traffic and annoy people, then could you please contact the people who cold call me and post shit through my letterbox everyday. Cheers!

Different strokes for different folks I guess....personally I'd rather build something thats going to be around and still making me money 6 months from now.
Dont see the appeal of churning out crappy site after crappy site when you could just put effort into 1 site, make it decent, give value to a community and make more money than all those crap-tastic sites put together.

That's great. I've built communities, email lists and forums before and they outlive most of my sites.
But many whitehats go bla ck hat because one day they get a penalty and all that work is destroyed, or someone bombs their site with millions of spam links, or it gets hacked and someone puts viagra or paypal phishing pages on their site.
Doing spammy sites isn't just about it being easier and cheaper, it's also spreading risk.
If we lived in a time where Google rewarded whitehats fairly, and stopped people cheating or screwing eachother over then I would be building more authority sites.
Hi NickWatson, are these all tools like SEOnuke,sick submitter,scrapebox going to be part of Blackhat SEO if I understand correctly...as all these tools you mentioned are mentioned in a blackhat forum bro...what's your say on this??
